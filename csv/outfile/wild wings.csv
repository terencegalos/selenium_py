As the school bus pulls around the corner, the mother gently tries to coax her young son out of his Radio Flyer, but he doesn’t want to leave the comfort of his mother's arms, the safety of his yard, or his trusted friend, ‘Buddy.’ The youngster will soon take that first step onto the bus, leaving, for the first time, the security of home.”

MOOSE TRACKS SCULPTURE,6567460868,,"The Moose (Alces alces) is commonly believed to be a slow-witted, quick-tempered, clumsy animal with poor vision. His massive size, broadly palmated antlers and long muzzle make him North Americas mightiest and most exotic antlered animal. He is the largest member of the deer family and perfectly suited to life in the worlds boreal forests and wetlands. It stands 6feet tall from shoulders to feet. A male moose can weight as much as 1,600 pounds. The moose has long, thick brown fur. Moose hair is hollow, which helps keep the moose warm. The moose has long legs. Its front legs are longer than itsrear legs. This helps it jump over fallen trees and other forest debris. It has a long head with a large nose and upper lip. It has small ears, a small tail, and a dewlap hanging on its throat. It has powerful shoulder muscles that give it a humpbacked appearance. Of the seven sub-species of moose in the world, four live in North America. The Eastern Moose (Alces alces americana) can be found in the New England states, Alces alces andersoni is found in Minnesota, Michigan and in central Canada, the Alaskan Moose (Alces alces gigas) can be found in Alaska and the Yukon, and Shiras Moose (Alces alces shirasi) which can be found primarily in north western Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, the Colorado Rockies and Southern Canada.

ANTIQUE BARN ORIGINAL ARTWORK ART COLLECTION,F474025096,,"I spent a glorious childhood exploring my family's 92 acres of Pennsylvania woodlands. We lived in a huge eclectic home which had been built around an ancient one room log cabin. The porperty was filled with outbuildings of all sorts and sizes and we were surrounded by large working farmsteads. One nearby farm was no longer fertile enough to support the family, but they simply refused to give up and decided to convert it into an antique auction barn. Thus I like to say that my painting entitled 'Antique Barn' was inspired by the efforts of all hard working Americans who refuse to throw in the towel. I have filled it with humor and nostalgic images. From trucks and tractors to baby carriages, rowboats, wildlife, kids, toys, tools, an antique indian motorcycle and more...literally something for everyone.

High above the steeple, the circling pigeons have been scattered by ringing bells.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

SPRING FEVER ART COLLECTION,F701505089,,"In this delightful image we remember a time when the world was a symphony of youthful shouts, glorious blue skies and secret hideaways in the trees.

CAMPFIRE TALES ART COLLECTION,F701155089,,"As a boy, Terry Redlin listened in awe as his father carefully planned hunting and fishing trips. He never forgot the excitement and wonder of those special times. The homemade camper top on the old pickup is a forerunner of the modern versions. The four deer are secretly watching the activities. Only in the morning will tracks reveal their presence. The man launching the wooden canoe occasionally _x001C_dipped,_x001D_ as we detect from the Copenhagen can vaguely outlined in his rear pocket. And the group's tall storyteller relaxes in a folding chair, hands extended, to recall the big one that got away. As the misty smoke rises to greet the moon we, too, can share in Terry Redlin's unique vision of man's romantic encounter with the wild.

RUSHING RAPIDS ART COLLECTION,F701446889,,"“Three Goldeneyes skim the river’s surface and head upstream looking for quieter water. These birds are commonly known as ‘whistlers’ because of the loud, high pitched sound of their wings in flight. Here Terry Redlin treats us to a vivid contrast of color and movement. The horizontal center of warm browns and oranges is essentially static. Cool blues and greys frame this center, and the rushing water and straining Goldeneyes quickly bring the viewer into the scene’s focus of high action.”

Like the farmers he served, breakfast was before sunup and work already started as morning light broke over the horizon. But a country doctor’s demanding schedule offered clear advantages; the regenerative powers of solitude and nature, regular visits with old friends, and the satisfaction of knowing his efforts were appreciated.”

WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701583589,,"It's Wednesday afternoon, traditional time off from a country doctor's busy schedule. The fishing pole is strapped to the buggy before leaving home in the morning. The baskets of produce, barter payment from his morning patients, will provide refreshment for the remainder of the day. Perhaps the doctor will stop to wet his line at the stream just ahead, or continue on to the secluded lake just beyond the distant hills.

BATTLING ELK ART COLLECTION,F780060066,,"The shrill whistle of a bugling bull elk is a classic symbol of the West. Beginning in late summer, the elk rut extends into October. During that time bulls wallow in creeks, springs and small wet depressions, urinate on themselves and bellow challenges. They also assemble harems of cows, a unique behavior in the deer family. A mature bull may gather 20 or more cows and attempt to fend off bulls that try to breed a stray cow while the he isn't looking. Most of these encounters are settled without a fight; but things can turn deadly serious. The two bulls walk parallel and stare each other down. Then one spins in for the attack, and the fight is on. Grunting and heaving, the dueling pair tear up sod as they fight. After many minutes, one bull wins the day, but always at a cost; gouges, scars and punctures are standard for rutting elk. But those wounds are worth it for the right to rule the herd.

GUARDIAN OF CONSERVATION ART COLLECTION,F701287089,,"“It is just before sunset in the fall of the year. The water wheel at the old grist mill is still working although now the rustic building is most often used as a banquet hall. The elusive blue heron keeps a keen eye on the fish at the water’s edge and observes all his surroundings at the same time. Above him geese divert the attention of three Labradors and an Irish setter. As the dogs turn back to watch the heron, he’s gone! The relationship between man and wildlife is one of modern civilization’s continuing dilemmas. The blue heron fishing is a symbol of good ecology. This is proof that the contestants are capable of living in harmony.”

SPRING ON THE GREENS ART COLLECTION,F701520089,,"“The artist’s first golf scene, this image is reminiscent of many courses across the country. The golf bags propped against the tree lead us to believe that two golfers must be off in the woods searching for a missing ball. This hole, almost completely surrounded by water, is a golfer’s greatest challenge. Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

THE WRANGLERS ART COLLECTION,F101908098,,"“Whenever I climbed up in the old saddle that I had hung on the rail fence, the magic would begin. I would be Sheriff Warren of Apache County, out to capture Black Bart or The Sedona Kid being pursued by a gang of ruthless bandits. One summer my cousin Kelsey came to visit. She would climb up behind me on the saddle and join my adventure. I think she called herself something like ‘Six Gun Kate’ and she said she would cover my back from the desperados. The adventure never felt quite right with a girl hanging on my back. I don’t think Sheriff Warren really needed a part time deputy.”

EVENING FROST ART COLLECTION,F701190089,,"“The dropping evening temperature has turned the moist air into a frosty white wonderland, with every surface sparkling in the moon’s bright beams. The covered bridge, with lanterns hanging at both ends, guide the horse and sleigh safely across its slippery surface. Listen, can you hear the jingle of the bell harness in the still night? The large Christmas tree will soon be delivered to the nearby church, then gaily decorated for the coming season’s celebrations. Rarely does Terry Redlin create a painting without some hint of surrounding wildlife, and this beautiful image in no exception. Careful observers will note a deserted bird's nest clinging to the inside roof of the bridge. A few months ago swallows called this home.”

Mom, while trying to maintain her composure, is finding it hard to smile for the picture. As he takes another look around, he remembers growing up here. So many memories. He glances over at his car.

The store owner is lowering the flag for the evening and the children are gone now-probably back to school. The dogs are still around, they have learned over the past few months that the store owner has table scraps from the restaurant in his bucket. The sounds of birds chirping and children laughing have been replaced with the quiet rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of water on the shore. It is the end of a peaceful day and the beginning of a whole new season.”

COMING HOME ART COLLECTION,F701178689,,"In this nostalgic scene 'coming home' becomes a place and a feeling. It speaks to us of a tradition we share, if not in actual fact, then in the values it represents. The Christmas tree has been cut from just down the road. We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

EVENING STAR ART COLLECTION,F701220089,,"“The first star to appear in the evening sky twinkles more brightly than the others. It is the planet Venus, but stargazers prefer to call it the Evening Star. The children have just finished a long day of tobogganing and sledding and are now working on their new friend, the snowman. The dogs are tired from playing in the snow, but not too tired to spot the rabbit. Beneath the hill, the skating rink is encircled with cars filled with spectators to the evening’s entertainment. As the headlights burn through the ground fog, they become spotlights on the young skaters. In this image, Terry Redlin captures the magic of this snowy winter playground.”

MIGRATION DAYS ART COLLECTION,F701344489,,"“Literally hundreds of thousands of waterfowl fill the skies during one week each spring. They have responded to a primordial urge to head north. Leaving their winter resting areas as far south as Central America, these graceful wanderers will guide their way to summer nesting areas in Canada and the northern tier of states. It's such a grand sight that those who have experienced this magic time count it among their most cherished memories. In this image, it appears the entire town has gathered to celebrate and share in the sounds and sights of the glorious migration flight. The honkers flying low are locals now having already arrived. But the blues and snow geese are flying high as they journey farther north.

FAMILY TIME ART COLLECTION,F701235089,,"“Three generations of the same family gather together on this spring morning for a relaxed day of fishing. Grandpa, sitting on a discarded wagon tongue, still uses his trusty old cane pole. The grandkids are equipped with new model rods and reels. Dad carefully baits his son’s hook, while the family dog watches intently. It is a special time, a peaceful time, for both young and old to renew a shared kinship in the spectacular beauty of a rural landscape. For this old farmstead to survive, it has become ‘Lakeside Trails,’ a hobby farm catering to horse owners from a nearby city. The land, once planted with corn and wheat, today boards horses and provides beautiful trails through the rolling countryside for the owner’s city neighbors to enjoy.”

LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

NATURE'S SENTINEL ART COLLECTION,F701385089,,"I have often wandered off alone into the woods, Terry Redlin comments, ""and waited very quietly and still in one place for a long period. After a while the birds, squirrels and other small animals have become comfortable with my presence and gone about their normal activities. But when deer have approached, these small creatures would begin to make a racket, sending out a warning that something strange and possibly dangerous was in the area. I've actually experienced this behavior several times. It's a bit eerie but, also, comforting to understand that nature's creatures seem to watch out for each other.""

BATTLING CARIBOU ART COLLECTION,F780059066,,"Mature caribou bulls may be the most handsome of deer. Their snow-white manes and towering antlers cut a striking figure in the barren tundra they call home. But there's a purpose behind those gorgeous manes and incredible racks. Because of the wide open nature of the tundra, caribou are the most visually oriented of the deer species, and a bull's stature is often determined by how large and dominant he appears to other bulls. The caribou rut is also unique, as it takes place when the animals migrate. Hundreds of animals may be moving together, covering many miles a day. This makes rituals like scraping (whitetails) and gathering harems (elk) impossible, so caribou love and fight on the run. Most of the time, the bulls that appear the largest are able to intimidate their rivals. But occasionally, evenly matched bulls will confront each other and a brief but furious shoving match determines dominance.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043,F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043,,,wildwings800,F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043

The raw-cut lumber piles higher and higher in the open shed. It will be stored here to cure for a while, then delivered to waiting lumberyards in nearby towns. 'The painting was a challenge,' the artist comments, 'because I needed to combine several sources of light. Hopefully the eye moves easily from one area of bustling activity to another.'”

HARVEST TIME—WHITETAIL DEER ART COLLECTION,F780282065,,"“Mike, being an avid hunter himself, understands the thrill of the moment and excitement of the hunt.

All hunters have been in the same (or similar) situation and can relate to this image by Michael Sieve, 'Harvest Time.'”

As Cinderella and her prince cross the stone bridge over the lover's reflecting pool, we pause to enjoy the numerous details that make this scene so inviting. Cinderella's many friends are here. This is proof positive that for Cinderella's deepest wishes to come true, she'll need a little help from her friends!

LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”

HIGHLIGHT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ART COLLECTION,F701310089,,"“On this beautiful summer evening in the 1950's, the Schwan's ice cream truck is making its final stop of the day. The kids, who have been waiting its arrival at the lighted park area, now enjoy their freshly scooped cones. As a softball game begins, the driver delivers a carefully wrapped package of ice cream to the nearby house. Intently watching from a window, the cat knows that she may soon savor the soft, sweet leftovers from the bottom of an ice cream bowl. This painting captures Terry Redlin's idyllic view of a child's perfect summer evening. According to the artist, 'There is no better treat on a hot summer's night than ice cream!'”

A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

The doe, knowing all is well in front, turns her head to watch for predators. Note the small trio of wildflower blooms in the foreground. Nature has found the perfect protected spot for these wayward seeds to flourish.”

HOMETOWN ART COLLECTION,F701249089,,"“This painting captures the romance of a snowy winter night. Two deer have a clear view of the town below the hill. As the smoke from the surrounding chimneys wafts through the evening air, they slowly begin their nightly journey to the cornfield just beyond the bed and breakfast. We can see from the tracks in the snow, that this is their favorite route. The headlights encircling the skating rink tell us that the evening’s entertainment has begun. We can almost hear the muffled laughter and the scraping of skate blades on the ice.

MORNING WARM UP ART COLLECTION,F701375089,,"“Dawn is breaking as the canoe-topped sedan and trailer loaded with decoys chugs up to Leslie's Blacksmith Shop and Sports Store. Earlier arrivals, a friendly combination of farmers in their bib overalls and town folk in fancier outfits, are already warming up around the glowing forge.

SNOW WHITE DISCOVERS THE COTTAGE ART COLLECTION,F435715196,,"As a child my imagination was stirred by the great animated films of Walt Disney. Imagine my delight when Disney recently opened their archives to me as I prepared for my first-ever series of images inspired by classic Disney moments.

In the first piece of this series, Snow White's world is alive with color. The Prince's castle where Snow White will eventually discover happiness looms majestically in the distance, while a foaming waterfall and fanciful animals remind us that Snow White is at peace with all of nature. Of course, I also included my iconic colorful flowers which festoon the scene with hopeful reminders of spring.

I hope that Snow White Discovers the Cottage will be a fairy tale come true for Disney and Kinkade collectors everywhere.

TINKER BELL AND PETER PAN FLY TO NEVERLAND ART COLLECTION,F435806696,,"As with the first two paintings in my twelve piece Disney Dreams Collection (affectionately referred to as the ""Disney dozen"" by die hard collectors!), I try to tell the whole story in a single image – what I refer to as a ""narrative panorama"". We see Neverland in the distance, just below the ""second star to the right"", as the full moon bathes the scene with its silvery glow. The lights of London twinkle along the river Thames, as the clouds take shape, if only in our imagination, as characters from the adventure – Captain Hook, Smee, the Lost Boys and the ubiquitous ticking crocodile. But for me, the central character of the story will always remain Tinker Bell, the enchanted fairy princess who makes the entire journey of imagination possible.

A new family of wood ducks rests on the warm shoreline rocks. Once again, we are reminded that man and wildlife can co-exist; and thanks to the efforts of conservationists everywhere, we will continue to enjoy this balance in nature.”

This image is also something of a self-portrait because I am the boy pulling the lunch wagon.’ Notice that the kids have more in mind than a day filled with farm chores. Soon they will be off to a nearby lake, pulling the gear-laden wagon appropriately named, ‘Terry’s Fishing Rig.’”

The dogs, anticipating their favorite sport, have scattered the once neatly stacked wooden decoys in the yard. As a trio of mallards wing quietly across the setting sun, only one dog notices. Soon it will be dark and the family will retire to the cabin for supper. With a workshop separate from the main cabin, Mom and Dad each have, in the artist’s words, “their own piece of heaven.”

BORDER WARS—WHITETAIL DEER ART COLLECTION,1780066065,,"In 1918 a hunter named John Breen took a great buck in the Minnesota northwoods. The 'Breen Buck' would be scored by the Boone & Crocket Club and recognized as the first World Record Typical Whitetail. It would hold that title until it was de-throned in 1971. The deer that knocked the Breen Buck from its top position was taken by Jim Jordan in Wisconsin in 1914, but for years the head and horns were lost. Interestingly, Jordan's buck was taken near the Yellow River; only a few miles from the Minnesota/Wisconsin border. So two of the world record whitetails were taken only 4 years and a short distance apart. The proximity of these two deer in time and distance fosters comparisons and some rivalry between deer hunters of each of the two states. And so with this hunting history in mind, Michael Sieve, loyal to the great state of Minnesota, teamed up with Greg Alexander, passionate resident of Wisconsin, to paint these two great bucks in an epic confrontation along their common border. Each artist attempting to portray his home state's famous buck as the more impressive of the two. Set of three art prints from the Border Wars collaboration by Greg Alexander and Michael Sieve featuring the Minnesota and Wisconsin record bucks.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,,,wildwings800,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160

Even when two prime bulls encounter one another, a bad attitude may be enough to make one animal back down. The pair will trot around, flashing antlers, raking brush and groaning a challenge. They may even rip vegetation from the ground with their mouths, jerking their heads up in a boastful swagger. Often, one of the bulls gives up and wanders off. But if their size and belligerence match, the bulls will clash antlers in a furious shoving match. The ensuing fight is among Nature's most awesome displays. Eventually one bull tires, turns and runs. The victor may slam its monstrous rack into the loser's body or backside as he leaves. His strength and courage have made him king for a day!""

Careful observers will also see in the Aroma Of Fall painting other faded memories from America's past: the prominent town bulletin board, the flag positioned proudly outside the general store and the familiar Maple Drive and Elm Street.

On that 'most special' of all mornings, he wakes up and before opening his eyes he knows the day has finally come; the first day of summer.

A STUDY IN WHITE—LITTLE GIRL ART COLLECTION,F101705098,,"My Grandmother, Anna Cooper, was given her mother’s wedding dress on her 16th birthday. Anna passed the dress onto my mother and my mother, in turn gave the gown to our daughter Kelsey.

Kelsey, on the other hand, was determined to enjoy her newly inherited treasure to the fullest. Each morning she would ceremoniously don her wedding dress and veil and clomp around the block in her mother’s white heels. She would stop by the Save-Rite Market and accept the warm smiles and flowery compliments from any of our neighbors who happened to be shopping there at that early hour. That summer we referred to her as our dusty hemmed “Study in White!”

EVENING ON THE ICE ART COLLECTION,F701198089,,"“Growing up in eastern South Dakota, I loved to hunt and fish. In the winter, the lakes turned into small towns bustling with activity. One of the best forms of entertainment was ice fishing! Vehicles would drive out to the ‘hot spots’ and while the fishermen would swap stories and unwind from a long work-week, everyone would watch and wait for a bite! Today, it is no different. I look out from my studio and the frozen lake is alive with ice houses, vehicles, and snowmobiles. The enjoyment I get from watching these winter activities inspired this painting.”

Soon the geese will disrupt this basic training and the controlled practice session will erupt into uncontrollable chaos.

CLOSE TO PARADISE ART COLLECTION,F701165089,,"Who is closer to paradise?asks Terry Redlin. ""Is it the man and his canine companion who have found this secluded fishing hole?

As in many Redlin paintings we find specific reminders of his boyhood. The artist owns and continues to use an old six-horse Evinrude outboard. Back in those days, it was legal to fish from two lines.

WELCOME TO PARADISE ART COLLECTION,F701585089,,"“The store owner in this backwoods retreat is a true entrepreneur, offering everything a sportsman might need: cane fishing poles, decoys, guns, shells, fuel, refreshments, groceries. While the visiting hunters are inside stocking up, the main action appears overhead as a flock of mallards set their wings in break and flutter down for a night's rest. Notice the pole flag at the rear of the jeep. Personal experience has informed the owner that vehicles left in high grass can be easily misplaced after the day's hunt. Careful observers also will see the tree sign listing the population of Paradise at thirteen. This includes the dog resting in front of the store, but does not imply any bad luck for sportsmen who have found their way to Paradise.”

BATTLING MULE DEER ART COLLECTION,F780058065,,"Young mule bucks spar frequently and the sessions teach them quickly how to gauge another buck's virility just by looking at his antlers, body size, and attitude. It's a valuable skill, one that saves many bucks from serious injury or death. A mature mule deer buck is an impressive animal who can weigh up to 350 pounds and have heavy, sprawling antlers nearly three feet wide. Like the bucks in this painting, many mule deer fights take place on steep ground, and the buck who uses his strength and the terrain to his advantage is often the winner - sometimes knocking his opponent off his feet or even flipping him on his back. If the loser can't regain his footing and flee, the victor will gouge him with his heavy antlers, ripping his ear, tearing his hide, even impaling his rib cage. While usually short, mule deer fights have the potential to be deadly!

Fortunately, we remember the takes, and not the refusals—otherwise, most of us might long since have taken up golf.”

SHORELINE NEIGHBORS ART COLLECTION,F701480289,,"“The human inhabitants who live in this location have taken special efforts to welcome the arriving wildlife. The gentle, meandering stream offers a natural haven for visiting waterfowl, but these two Canadian honkers have discovered an unusual and ideal nesting spot. Conservationists have placed a tightly rolled hay bale at water's edge. The bale was donated by a local farmer and was carefully spotted on the ice during the previous winter. As spring arrived and the ice melted, the bale dropped into its appointed place. Such innovative thinking is a beautiful example of how man and nature are working together to become good 'Shoreline Neighbors.'”

After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear.

PREPARED FOR THE SEASON ART COLLECTION,F701435089,,"We see that hunting and fishing activities have been a tradition with this farm family. Three deer racks decorate the barn wall. Beneath, the fishing boat and canoe patiently wait for spring. But today attention is on the opening of duck season. Equipment reclaimed from annual hibernation has been checked, cleaned and rechecked. The Dodge pickup is loaded with a homemade duck boat and wooden decoys. Two favorite shotguns stand guard at the cab door. Last minute plans are reviewed in the nearby shed. Then, as if to officially signal both the beginning of an annual ritual and the end of a truce, three mallards break the still air in a final flyby.

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FALLING IN LOVE ART COLLECTION,F435100096,,"Of all the Disney love stories, perhaps Beauty and the Beast is the most poignant. Beast's true identity is a charming prince who is discovering love in the form of the beautiful Belle. ""Beauty and the Beast Falling in Love"" memorializes that magic moment when they first begin to discover their love for each other. Many of the characters from the movie are present, including Belle's eccentric father Maurice, the wonderful characters of Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and of course, Lumiere.

In the distance, we see the village that is a central setting for many of the film's most important moments. As with every piece in the Disney Dreams Collection, the painting is a panorama portrayal of the entire movie, rather than an individual scene. The viewer's eye is able wander around the painting making discoveries in every corner of the image. The crowning achievement and the central discovery in the image is the sweeping sense of romance that is at the core of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. Here truly is unconditional love in its purest form.

He has also perfected the siren which he shares with strangers at the mall on a weekly basis.

It was hard work but it was well worth our efforts when we got to thumb through the L. L. May prize book at the end of the day.”

THE LOST SHOE ART COLLECTION,F101460098,,"She was hot and tired and just about at the end of her rope. Her mother had sent her down to get groceries at Sweeney’s and had also insisted that she take her youngest brother Davie with her. All the way down and half the way back he talked incessantly about some dumb dog he had seen eating out of a garbage can a few days earlier. She more or less blocked out his ramblings and she didn’t notice when he suddenly got very quiet. “Sissy, my shoe’s gone!” brought her out of her daydream. Back down the road she went for the lost shoe because she had a pretty good idea of what would happen to a girl who brought home a one-shoe, little brother.

SILENT FLIGHT HORIZON ART COLLECTION,F701483889,,"Considered by many to be a painter only of waterfowl and upland game birds, in reality Terry Redlin's interests extend well beyond the boundaries of redheads and ring-necks.

As darkness approaches the owl is preparing for an evening of good hunting. Its ability to maneuver in near perfect silence means trouble for all small nocturnal animals. Few people are privileged to see this largest of our eared owls, but you may have heard its soft and haunting 'hoo-hoo-hoooo' from deep in the night.

OLD MOSSY HORNS—DEER ART COLLECTION,F913505065,,"In the fall of 1958, Al Dawson missed a shot at the deer with whom he would begin a five-year game of hide and seek. The huge non-typical had a massive array of brow points and two long drop tines that reminded him of moss hanging from the rack, thus Dawson named the great buck, 'Old Mossy Horns. ' This game of cat and mouse was taking place in the Platte River bottoms near Shelton, Nebraska. A tough place to hunt, but a great place for a buck to hide. In 1962, Dawson's hope of taking the buck ran out. Late one afternoon, another hunter named Del Austin, saw a huge deer ghosting through the twilight. His arrow flew true, but until the downed deer was recovered next morning, he did not know for certain he had ended the five-year challenge. In the end, only persistence and luck would place the buck in the record books as the best non-typical whitetail by bow.
