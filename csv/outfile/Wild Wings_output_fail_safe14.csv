BACK TO THE SANCTUARY HORIZON ART COLLECTION,F701124089,,"“It's a peaceful late winter afternoon. The whitetail deer are out foraging for browse. While the buck nibbles at the tender branch, two does intuitively sense that something is out of order, and peer intently toward the hidden viewer. However, it is obvious these deer understand the limits of their territory and have retreated behind the sign left from last fall.”

BORDER WARS—WHITETAIL DEER ART COLLECTION,1780066065,,"In 1918 a hunter named John Breen took a great buck in the Minnesota northwoods. The 'Breen Buck' would be scored by the Boone & Crocket Club and recognized as the first World Record Typical Whitetail. It would hold that title until it was de-throned in 1971. The deer that knocked the Breen Buck from its top position was taken by Jim Jordan in Wisconsin in 1914, but for years the head and horns were lost. Interestingly, Jordan's buck was taken near the Yellow River; only a few miles from the Minnesota/Wisconsin border. So two of the world record whitetails were taken only 4 years and a short distance apart. The proximity of these two deer in time and distance fosters comparisons and some rivalry between deer hunters of each of the two states. And so with this hunting history in mind, Michael Sieve, loyal to the great state of Minnesota, teamed up with Greg Alexander, passionate resident of Wisconsin, to paint these two great bucks in an epic confrontation along their common border. Each artist attempting to portray his home state's famous buck as the more impressive of the two. Set of three art prints from the Border Wars collaboration by Greg Alexander and Michael Sieve featuring the Minnesota and Wisconsin record bucks.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,,,wildwings800,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160

A new family of wood ducks rests on the warm shoreline rocks. Once again, we are reminded that man and wildlife can co-exist; and thanks to the efforts of conservationists everywhere, we will continue to enjoy this balance in nature.”

Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

She discovered them hiding behind her toy box. “Come out from there this minute or I shall tell everyone what I have found” she demanded. “Oh please don’t tell anyone about us” the fairies said. If you keep our secret we’ll give you something in return.” “What on earth could a bunch of silly fairies possibly give me?” said the little girl. After thinking for a moment, the tallest fairy proudly said, “We can teach you how to fly!” The fairies made good on their promise and the little girl didn’t have to ride the bus to preschool ever again.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit.

Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

REFLECTIONS—GREEN—WINGED TEAL ART COLLECTION,F701445089,,"“Set against the mood of a late afternoon sun, three green-winged teal twist and slip silently past two familiar landmarks; an old neglected fishing boat and a dock, witness to many a big catch, but now badly in need of repairs. These vestiges of man’s presence give pause to reflect back on other times and places.”

HIS FIRST DATE ART COLLECTION,F701243089,,"“As the full moon begins to rise, shadows dance across the yard. In this scene, we are reminded of the nervousness of ‘young love.’ The boy has a visitor. As the boy and girl sit side by side on the front porch, Mom knows this is her son’s first date. This must be the girl whose initials have recently appeared in the heart-shaped carving on the tree just below the tree house, his ‘Private Club.’ Keeping an eye on the two, Mom offers a tray of refreshments. Her baby is growing up. His dog, Buddy, has already given his approval. The family loves their neighborhood and the life they have built.”

After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear.

MORNING SOLITUDE ART COLLECTION,F701365189,,"“It’s that magical moment in the deep woods when the morning sun first slices through the thick underbrush to cover the landscape with its warm rays. The camper, an early riser, has loaded his fishing gear into the old wooden canoe and with his best buddy is headed out to catch breakfast. A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

CAMPING ON SUNSET POINT ART COLLECTION,F701157089,,"“Inspired by an account of a fellow conservationist who came to the aid of baby wood ducks in distress, this painting captures all the elements of the perfect setting. It is early spring and the air is cool as the sun goes down. The deer cautiously move through the trees, keenly aware of the campers, but not threatened by their presence. A new family of wood ducks rests on the warm shoreline rocks. Once again, we are reminded that man and wildlife can co-exist; and thanks to the efforts of conservationists everywhere, we will continue to enjoy this balance in nature.”

As services let out on this rainy Sunday, the heavens open up to shower the congregation with the sun's warm rays.”

GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE ART COLLECTION,F701270089,,"“Religion played an important role in early America. Churches became the center of not only religious but also social activities. In this scene frontier roughness gives way to gentler times. That new invention, the motor car, is starting to replace horses and buggies. The church is no longer built of wood, but solid brick. As services let out on this rainy Sunday, the heavens open up to shower the congregation with the sun's warm rays.”

HIS FIRST FRIEND ART COLLECTION,F701241689,,"The story begins with the American dream of home ownership as a young family moves from the farm into town. Their fixer-upper needs some tender love and care, but for now it is moving day. As they unpack the truck, they look forward to a whole new life for themselves and their young son. In this first scene, the young boy has a great surprise. He has just met his first friend, 'Buddy'. Terry Redlin remembers a similar move before first grade. ""My dog was an orphan my parents found at a dance. I named him Bootsie, because he had four dark paws. Bootsie was my first friend.""

THE HANSON BUCK ART COLLECTION,F913270065,,"It was late afternoon when I came upon the buck scrape. What size buck would make a scrape four feet long and half as wide? The answer, in the form of a fresh rub, was a few yards up the trail. The top was even with my eyes, which put it at five feet on level ground. They do indeed grow big whitetails in Saskatchewan! The biggest of all may have walked this trail. I was hunting with my camera and traveling to meet Milo Hanson, the one man who knows just how impressive a whitetail can be. Milo had claimed the new typical world record, replacing Jim Jordan's buck shot in 1914.
