LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

THE LOST SHOE ART COLLECTION,F101460098,,"She was hot and tired and just about at the end of her rope. Her mother had sent her down to get groceries at Sweeney’s and had also insisted that she take her youngest brother Davie with her. All the way down and half the way back he talked incessantly about some dumb dog he had seen eating out of a garbage can a few days earlier. She more or less blocked out his ramblings and she didn’t notice when he suddenly got very quiet. “Sissy, my shoe’s gone!” brought her out of her daydream. Back down the road she went for the lost shoe because she had a pretty good idea of what would happen to a girl who brought home a one-shoe, little brother.

HUNTER'S HAVEN ART COLLECTION,F701320189,,"Every sportsman can relate to this romantic image, if not as an actual place, then as an ideal constructed many times in the imagination.

SPRING ON THE GREENS ART COLLECTION,F701520089,,"“The artist’s first golf scene, this image is reminiscent of many courses across the country.

Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

Rarely does Terry Redlin create a painting without some hint of surrounding wildlife, and this beautiful image in no exception. Careful observers will note a deserted bird's nest clinging to the inside roof of the bridge. A few months ago swallows called this home.”

BEST FRIENDS ART COLLECTION,F701130489,,"“At sunset the man and his best friend have driven to the crest of the highest hill around. They've had a good day of hunting in the lakes and marshes below. Now both rest, but the man carefully watches the migrating patterns of the distant waterfowl. Tomorrow he'll have a better idea of where the best hunting will likely be. In this spectacular panorama we see a beautiful slice of rural America. Just follow the winding road past the gas station, then the bait shop, the farms, over the bridge and home to a town with its typical water tower and church steeple.”

SILENT FLIGHT HORIZON ART COLLECTION,F701483889,,"Considered by many to be a painter only of waterfowl and upland game birds, in reality Terry Redlin's interests extend well beyond the boundaries of redheads and ring-necks. This painting of the great horned owl offers a good example of, not only his subject versatility, but also his skillful handling of landscape detail, atmospheric mood and arresting composition. As darkness approaches the owl is preparing for an evening of good hunting. Its ability to maneuver in near perfect silence means trouble for all small nocturnal animals. Few people are privileged to see this largest of our eared owls, but you may have heard its soft and haunting 'hoo-hoo-hoooo' from deep in the night.

SUMMERTIME ART COLLECTION,F701530089,,"“In this nostalgic image Redlin revisits the sunny days of his youth. It was an innocent time when the most important thing in the world was to grab a pail and pole and hike out to the nearest fishing hole. The nearby bait shop offered ample refreshments for young appetites, including Langenfeld ice cream. The artist's wife was a member of the Langenfeld family, and the authentic sign is one of the personal touches we sometimes find in Redlin’s work.”

PREPARED FOR THE SEASON ART COLLECTION,F701435089,,"We see that hunting and fishing activities have been a tradition with this farm family. Three deer racks decorate the barn wall. Beneath, the fishing boat and canoe patiently wait for spring. But today attention is on the opening of duck season. Equipment reclaimed from annual hibernation has been checked, cleaned and rechecked. The Dodge pickup is loaded with a homemade duck boat and wooden decoys. Two favorite shotguns stand guard at the cab door. Last minute plans are reviewed in the nearby shed. Then, as if to officially signal both the beginning of an annual ritual and the end of a truce, three mallards break the still air in a final flyby.

SHORELINE NEIGHBORS ART COLLECTION,F701480289,,"“The human inhabitants who live in this location have taken special efforts to welcome the arriving wildlife. The gentle, meandering stream offers a natural haven for visiting waterfowl, but these two Canadian honkers have discovered an unusual and ideal nesting spot. Conservationists have placed a tightly rolled hay bale at water's edge. The bale was donated by a local farmer and was carefully spotted on the ice during the previous winter. As spring arrived and the ice melted, the bale dropped into its appointed place. Such innovative thinking is a beautiful example of how man and nature are working together to become good 'Shoreline Neighbors.'”

OLD MOSSY HORNS—DEER ART COLLECTION,F913505065,,"In the fall of 1958, Al Dawson missed a shot at the deer with whom he would begin a five-year game of hide and seek. The huge non-typical had a massive array of brow points and two long drop tines that reminded him of moss hanging from the rack, thus Dawson named the great buck, 'Old Mossy Horns. ' This game of cat and mouse was taking place in the Platte River bottoms near Shelton, Nebraska. A tough place to hunt, but a great place for a buck to hide. In 1962, Dawson's hope of taking the buck ran out. Late one afternoon, another hunter named Del Austin, saw a huge deer ghosting through the twilight. His arrow flew true, but until the downed deer was recovered next morning, he did not know for certain he had ended the five-year challenge. In the end, only persistence and luck would place the buck in the record books as the best non-typical whitetail by bow.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

SUMMERTIME ART COLLECTION,F701530089,,"“In this nostalgic image Redlin revisits the sunny days of his youth. It was an innocent time when the most important thing in the world was to grab a pail and pole and hike out to the nearest fishing hole. The nearby bait shop offered ample refreshments for young appetites, including Langenfeld ice cream. The artist's wife was a member of the Langenfeld family, and the authentic sign is one of the personal touches we sometimes find in Redlin’s work.”

NIGHT ON THE TOWN ART COLLECTION,F701390089,,"“The farmer and his wife have hitched up the sleigh, bundled the kids against the winter air and headed into town for last-minute holiday errands.
