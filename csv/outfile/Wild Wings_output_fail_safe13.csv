MORNING WARM UP ART COLLECTION,F701375089,,"“Dawn is breaking as the canoe-topped sedan and trailer loaded with decoys chugs up to Leslie's Blacksmith Shop and Sports Store. Earlier arrivals, a friendly combination of farmers in their bib overalls and town folk in fancier outfits, are already warming up around the glowing forge. Terry Redlin fondly remembers scenes such as this from his boyhood. Leslie was a local entrepreneur who expanded his farm into a blacksmith service, then to a cafe wrap-around on his barn, and finally to cabins along the stream for overnight guests. Terry especially recalls the clank of the hammer and pungent aroma of hot metal.”

SPRING FEVER ART COLLECTION,F701505089,,"In this delightful image we remember a time when the world was a symphony of youthful shouts, glorious blue skies and secret hideaways in the trees. On such carefree days friends gathered to test their homemade kites against the brisk spring breeze. The kites soar high and free, not at the end of new-fangled nylon line, but securely controlled by thick cotton string. The string has broken many times but is easily fixed, the knots' bulky presence visible even at this distance.

We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

NATURAL CURIOSITY ART COLLECTION,F701380089,,"“All animals are curious. Deer are especially cautious, too. On this quiet summer day, Terry Redlin remembers the behavior of animals he watched in the fields as a kid. The rail fence serves as a protector for both the fawn and the colt, allowing them the safety in which to satisfy their curiosity. The doe, knowing all is well in front, turns her head to watch for predators. Note the small trio of wildflower blooms in the foreground. Nature has found the perfect protected spot for these wayward seeds to flourish.”

MORNING SOLITUDE ART COLLECTION,F701365189,,"“It’s that magical moment in the deep woods when the morning sun first slices through the thick underbrush to cover the landscape with its warm rays. The camper, an early riser, has loaded his fishing gear into the old wooden canoe and with his best buddy is headed out to catch breakfast. A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

SEVEN CRITTERS—WHITETAIL DEER FRAMED PRINT,F018722865C,,"When I am out in the natural world, I can stop to find many wild creatures in one small area.

So next time you are out in creation, don't just drive through it, but rather stop to be the quiet observer, and you will see so much more.

PRAIRIE MONUMENTS—PHEASANTS ART COLLECTION,F701432089,,"“The deserted crossroads elevator was once at the center of a thriving farm community. It now stands mute, a victim of man’s progress.

The only witnesses to this transition are the calmly feeding pheasants.”

LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”
