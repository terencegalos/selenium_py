This painting captures Terry Redlin's idyllic view of a child's perfect summer evening. According to the artist, 'There is no better treat on a hot summer's night than ice cream!'”

HIS FIRST DATE ART COLLECTION,F701243089,,"“As the full moon begins to rise, shadows dance across the yard. In this scene, we are reminded of the nervousness of ‘young love.’ The boy has a visitor. As the boy and girl sit side by side on the front porch, Mom knows this is her son’s first date. This must be the girl whose initials have recently appeared in the heart-shaped carving on the tree just below the tree house, his ‘Private Club.’ Keeping an eye on the two, Mom offers a tray of refreshments. Her baby is growing up. His dog, Buddy, has already given his approval. The family loves their neighborhood and the life they have built.”

The cat patiently sits by the doorstep as our young man reunites with his dog. Colorfully wrapped packages and a freshly cut evergreen will soon surprise his family. This will be a special Holiday season for them all. In this painting, we are reminded of the peacefulness, the safety, and the comforts of home.”

BATTLING ELK ART COLLECTION,F780060066,,"The shrill whistle of a bugling bull elk is a classic symbol of the West. Beginning in late summer, the elk rut extends into October. During that time bulls wallow in creeks, springs and small wet depressions, urinate on themselves and bellow challenges. They also assemble harems of cows, a unique behavior in the deer family. A mature bull may gather 20 or more cows and attempt to fend off bulls that try to breed a stray cow while the he isn't looking. Most of these encounters are settled without a fight; but things can turn deadly serious. The two bulls walk parallel and stare each other down. Then one spins in for the attack, and the fight is on. Grunting and heaving, the dueling pair tear up sod as they fight. After many minutes, one bull wins the day, but always at a cost; gouges, scars and punctures are standard for rutting elk. But those wounds are worth it for the right to rule the herd.

COMING HOME ART COLLECTION,F701178689,,"In this nostalgic scene 'coming home' becomes a place and a feeling. It speaks to us of a tradition we share, if not in actual fact, then in the values it represents. The Christmas tree has been cut from just down the road. We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

MORNING WARM UP ART COLLECTION,F701375089,,"“Dawn is breaking as the canoe-topped sedan and trailer loaded with decoys chugs up to Leslie's Blacksmith Shop and Sports Store. Earlier arrivals, a friendly combination of farmers in their bib overalls and town folk in fancier outfits, are already warming up around the glowing forge. Terry Redlin fondly remembers scenes such as this from his boyhood. Leslie was a local entrepreneur who expanded his farm into a blacksmith service, then to a cafe wrap-around on his barn, and finally to cabins along the stream for overnight guests. Terry especially recalls the clank of the hammer and pungent aroma of hot metal.”

The old house has undergone a noticeable transformation. As the school bus pulls around the corner, the mother gently tries to coax her young son out of his Radio Flyer, but he doesn’t want to leave the comfort of his mother's arms, the safety of his yard, or his trusted friend, ‘Buddy.’ The youngster will soon take that first step onto the bus, leaving, for the first time, the security of home.”

GUARDIAN OF CONSERVATION ART COLLECTION,F701287089,,"“It is just before sunset in the fall of the year. The water wheel at the old grist mill is still working although now the rustic building is most often used as a banquet hall. The elusive blue heron keeps a keen eye on the fish at the water’s edge and observes all his surroundings at the same time. Above him geese divert the attention of three Labradors and an Irish setter. As the dogs turn back to watch the heron, he’s gone! The relationship between man and wildlife is one of modern civilization’s continuing dilemmas. The blue heron fishing is a symbol of good ecology. This is proof that the contestants are capable of living in harmony.”

BASIC TRAINING ART COLLECTION,F701127089,,"As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, it casts an amber glow across the land. Three generations gather on the end of the dock for one of many training sessions with their trusted hunting companions. As the young pup leaps off of the dock to retrieve, the older dogs watch and wait their turn—all but the oldest lab. He hears the robins squawking and is alerted to the geese flying overhead. This practice session is of no interest to him after years of retrieving with his master. Soon the geese will disrupt this basic training and the controlled practice session will erupt into uncontrollable chaos.

COMING HOME ART COLLECTION,F701178689,,"In this nostalgic scene 'coming home' becomes a place and a feeling. It speaks to us of a tradition we share, if not in actual fact, then in the values it represents. The Christmas tree has been cut from just down the road. We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

SPRING FISHING ART COLLECTION,F701510289,,"“These young fishermen come well equipped with fishing gear. Some sit on the bank watching patiently for the first nibble. Others relax in the shade amid a golden field of dandelions. Across the stream two Canada geese herd their brood to the water's edge. They are undisturbed by all the activity, having learned long ago to share this idyllic location with their human friends.”

ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN ART COLLECTION,F701030089,,"America became truly a land of plenty. The hard-working settlers harvested a bountiful variety of foods to feed a growing nation. Here the farmer and his family haul to town a wagon overflowing with corn, baskets of apples and containers of milk. My mother remembers doing this very thing when she was young. Overhead, pigeons have found their home atop the grain elevator, a sturdy monument to the rich soil and the people who toil on it.

SHORELINE NEIGHBORS ART COLLECTION,F701480289,,"“The human inhabitants who live in this location have taken special efforts to welcome the arriving wildlife. The gentle, meandering stream offers a natural haven for visiting waterfowl, but these two Canadian honkers have discovered an unusual and ideal nesting spot. Conservationists have placed a tightly rolled hay bale at water's edge. The bale was donated by a local farmer and was carefully spotted on the ice during the previous winter. As spring arrived and the ice melted, the bale dropped into its appointed place. Such innovative thinking is a beautiful example of how man and nature are working together to become good 'Shoreline Neighbors.'”

Thanks to thousands of concerned outdoorsmen and women, these beautiful ducks are today one of our most abundant waterfowl. This painting salutes one episode in this story. Early on a spring morning we watch as three generations of one family, working together, assure the next generation of wood ducks a secure nesting site.”

PATIENTLY WAITING ART COLLECTION,F701420089,,"“As the sun sets behind a hillside barn, two hunting dogs patiently wait for the farmers to finish harvesting. Overhead, a flight of honkers head for their evening resting place. The old pickup truck carries all necessary gear: shotgun, decoys, boat, lunch and welding equipment (handy for quick in-the-field repairs). Note the fishing pole topped with a red flag. You only need to lose your truck once in the tall slough grass! This classic scene nostalgically revisits a new remote rural way of life experienced by few, but fondly remembered by many.”

RIVERSIDE POND FRAMED OAK COLLAGE,5714112838,,"It's an autumn afternoon and this wood duck pair is preparing to leave. Perhaps they are taking one last trip around their riverside pond home before heading south. The quiet water, the deep woods safety, the available ground seeds, all combine to make this an ideal haven. Only the rough hewed hiking bridge in the background interrupts the natural tranquillity of the scene. But the wood duck, like the mallard, is an easy companion to man and this one intrusion did not disturb their stay. Careful observers will also note a small dark opening high in the tree trunk at the top right of the painting. This now empty nest awaits their return next spring.

SWEET MEMORIES ART COLLECTION,F701550089,,"The Palace of Sweets, a neighborhood candy store, was an actual place in the artist's youth.

A wagonload of children on a holiday hayride have stopped for a bit of shopping.""
