HIGHLIGHT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ART COLLECTION,F701310089,,"“On this beautiful summer evening in the 1950's, the Schwan's ice cream truck is making its final stop of the day. The kids, who have been waiting its arrival at the lighted park area, now enjoy their freshly scooped cones. As a softball game begins, the driver delivers a carefully wrapped package of ice cream to the nearby house. Intently watching from a window, the cat knows that she may soon savor the soft, sweet leftovers from the bottom of an ice cream bowl. This painting captures Terry Redlin's idyllic view of a child's perfect summer evening. According to the artist, 'There is no better treat on a hot summer's night than ice cream!'”

Cool blues and greys frame this center, and the rushing water and straining Goldeneyes quickly bring the viewer into the scene’s focus of high action.”

SILENT FLIGHT HORIZON ART COLLECTION,F701483889,,"Considered by many to be a painter only of waterfowl and upland game birds, in reality Terry Redlin's interests extend well beyond the boundaries of redheads and ring-necks. This painting of the great horned owl offers a good example of, not only his subject versatility, but also his skillful handling of landscape detail, atmospheric mood and arresting composition. As darkness approaches the owl is preparing for an evening of good hunting. Its ability to maneuver in near perfect silence means trouble for all small nocturnal animals. Few people are privileged to see this largest of our eared owls, but you may have heard its soft and haunting 'hoo-hoo-hoooo' from deep in the night.

HIS FIRST FRIEND ART COLLECTION,F701241689,,"The story begins with the American dream of home ownership as a young family moves from the farm into town.

In this first scene, the young boy has a great surprise. He has just met his first friend, 'Buddy'. Terry Redlin remembers a similar move before first grade.

EVENING ON THE ICE ART COLLECTION,F701198089,,"“Growing up in eastern South Dakota, I loved to hunt and fish. In the winter, the lakes turned into small towns bustling with activity. One of the best forms of entertainment was ice fishing! Vehicles would drive out to the ‘hot spots’ and while the fishermen would swap stories and unwind from a long work-week, everyone would watch and wait for a bite! Today, it is no different. I look out from my studio and the frozen lake is alive with ice houses, vehicles, and snowmobiles. The enjoyment I get from watching these winter activities inspired this painting.”

Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”

COMING HOME ART COLLECTION,F701178689,,"In this nostalgic scene 'coming home' becomes a place and a feeling. It speaks to us of a tradition we share, if not in actual fact, then in the values it represents. The Christmas tree has been cut from just down the road. We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

THE MASTER'S DOMAIN—ELK FRAMED MASTER STROKE OVAL,5714477505,,"“Within a landscape of majestic proportions, three elk pause, silently surveying their wilderness domain. We can easily imagine that only Indians, mountainmen and wildlife have ever traversed its secluded and pristine beauty. But these possibilities become insignificant in the presence of the mountain. Mute and seemingly eternal, it conveys to the surrounding terrain a sense of both beauty and supreme power. As we contemplate this scene we come to realize that man can best appreciate nature, and that its forces are beyond our understanding or ultimate control.”

PREPARED FOR THE SEASON ART COLLECTION,F701435089,,"We see that hunting and fishing activities have been a tradition with this farm family. Three deer racks decorate the barn wall. Beneath, the fishing boat and canoe patiently wait for spring. But today attention is on the opening of duck season. Equipment reclaimed from annual hibernation has been checked, cleaned and rechecked. The Dodge pickup is loaded with a homemade duck boat and wooden decoys. Two favorite shotguns stand guard at the cab door. Last minute plans are reviewed in the nearby shed. Then, as if to officially signal both the beginning of an annual ritual and the end of a truce, three mallards break the still air in a final flyby.

AROMA OF FALL ART COLLECTION,F701105689,,"The Aroma Of Fall painting encourages you to pause for a moment and return to a simpler time and place when the aroma of burning leaves in the fall air signaled the changing of seasons. It was a more innocent era before an expanding population created environmental concerns, and when harvesting of summer's foliage was a small town ritual. Careful observers will also see in the Aroma Of Fall painting other faded memories from America's past: the prominent town bulletin board, the flag positioned proudly outside the general store and the familiar Maple Drive and Elm Street.

After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear.

GUARDIAN OF CONSERVATION ART COLLECTION,F701287089,,"“It is just before sunset in the fall of the year. The water wheel at the old grist mill is still working although now the rustic building is most often used as a banquet hall. The elusive blue heron keeps a keen eye on the fish at the water’s edge and observes all his surroundings at the same time. Above him geese divert the attention of three Labradors and an Irish setter. As the dogs turn back to watch the heron, he’s gone! The relationship between man and wildlife is one of modern civilization’s continuing dilemmas. The blue heron fishing is a symbol of good ecology. This is proof that the contestants are capable of living in harmony.”

Each detail is important and builds on the thrill of the moment giving the hunter a chance to relive each second. All hunters have been in the same (or similar) situation and can relate to this image by Michael Sieve, 'Harvest Time.'”

The string has broken many times but is easily fixed, the knots' bulky presence visible even at this distance.

INSPIRATION—YOUNG MUSICIANS ART COLLECTION,F101229598,,"Carpenter Elementary School, the annual orchestra concert, and Leila had been chosen to perform an eight bar violin solo for the invited grandmas, grandpas, moms, dads, aunts, uncles and elected local officials. She had diligently practiced her small part for weeks but still, as she and the other orchestra students waited back stage, she was filled with a feeling of impending doom and a major case of stage fright. At that moment she turned her head and saw the wondrous magic parade of carriages, filled with concert orchestra musicians playing the same eight bars that she had labored so long to perfect. When she heard their beautiful sounds she knew that her solo performance was going to be fine. She had found her inspiration and her Grandma would be very proud.

COUNTRY NEIGHBORS ART COLLECTION,F701180089,,"“In this romantic setting we are transported to a time and place where the meaning of ‘country neighbors’ is beautifully apparent. The day’s work for both man and wildlife is completed. The pickup is loaded and ready for a trip to town in the morning. The exhausted farmer will relax for a moment on the high porch to enjoy the sunset before heading for bed. The mallards swing in low for the last time this season. After a good night’s rest they will begin their annual journey south. Off in the distance the country church offers a neighborly reminder of who, really, is in charge of nature’s abundant gifts.”

PREPARED FOR THE SEASON ART COLLECTION,F701435089,,"We see that hunting and fishing activities have been a tradition with this farm family. Three deer racks decorate the barn wall. Beneath, the fishing boat and canoe patiently wait for spring. But today attention is on the opening of duck season. Equipment reclaimed from annual hibernation has been checked, cleaned and rechecked. The Dodge pickup is loaded with a homemade duck boat and wooden decoys. Two favorite shotguns stand guard at the cab door. Last minute plans are reviewed in the nearby shed. Then, as if to officially signal both the beginning of an annual ritual and the end of a truce, three mallards break the still air in a final flyby.

THE JUNGLE BOOK ART COLLECTION,F435375096,,"There is little doubt that ""The Jungle Book"" remains one of the most delightful and warmly received of all of the Disney animated films. This is the last film that Walt Disney was involved with both in terms of production and writing before his death in 1966. ""Let's have fun with it,"" Walt was often quoted as saying to his animation staff about their efforts on the film. And that is exactly what the talent pool of The Walt Disney Studios did with the story of Mowgli, the Indian jungle boy raised by wolves, befriended by bears and panthers and stalked by pythons and tigers.

The narrative panoramic style of the collection is fully realized on this canvas with each of the film's many enchanting scenes. The chaos of King Louie, the joy of the baby elephant walk and the waterside romance at the ""man village"" were all integrated into the painting's completion. And at the center of it all is Mowgli the man cub, the evil tiger Shere Khan, the wise panther Bagheera and Baloo, the lovable if lazy Poppa Bear. Set in a verdant jungle and highlighted by flowers, waterfalls and palms, one can almost smell the canopied gardenias, sense the rushing of the water and hear the chatter of the monkeys in the trees. Indeed, the magic of Walt Disney as interpreted by Thomas Kinkade Studios has never been more likely to transport the collector to the experience of the cinematic moment. Let us all take that journey, ""have fun with it"" and ""look for the bare necessities of life!""
