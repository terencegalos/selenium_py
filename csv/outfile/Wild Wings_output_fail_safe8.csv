LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”
