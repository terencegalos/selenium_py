We sense the myriad wild faces that have come to watch us. But there is no need to be alarmed. The wildlife at this backwoods cabin mean no harm. On this fresh morning, stroll down the steps from the hillside cabin. Sit by the lake, quiet and watchful. One of nature’s wonders, a trio of wood ducks, glide to a landing just across the inlet.”

BACKWOODS CABIN ART COLLECTION,F701125189,,"“Somewhere is that special hideaway that puts us in close touch with the wild. When found, and if we are in the right mood, the roles between man and wildlife are reversed.

We sense the myriad wild faces that have come to watch us. But there is no need to be alarmed. The wildlife at this backwoods cabin mean no harm. On this fresh morning, stroll down the steps from the hillside cabin. Sit by the lake, quiet and watchful. One of nature’s wonders, a trio of wood ducks, glide to a landing just across the inlet.”

The raw-cut lumber piles higher and higher in the open shed. It will be stored here to cure for a while, then delivered to waiting lumberyards in nearby towns. 'The painting was a challenge,' the artist comments, 'because I needed to combine several sources of light. Hopefully the eye moves easily from one area of bustling activity to another.'”

CAMPFIRE TALES ART COLLECTION,F701155089,,"As a boy, Terry Redlin listened in awe as his father carefully planned hunting and fishing trips. He never forgot the excitement and wonder of those special times. The homemade camper top on the old pickup is a forerunner of the modern versions. The four deer are secretly watching the activities. Only in the morning will tracks reveal their presence. The man launching the wooden canoe occasionally _x001C_dipped,_x001D_ as we detect from the Copenhagen can vaguely outlined in his rear pocket. And the group's tall storyteller relaxes in a folding chair, hands extended, to recall the big one that got away. As the misty smoke rises to greet the moon we, too, can share in Terry Redlin's unique vision of man's romantic encounter with the wild.

RUSHING RAPIDS ART COLLECTION,F701446889,,"“Three Goldeneyes skim the river’s surface and head upstream looking for quieter water. These birds are commonly known as ‘whistlers’ because of the loud, high pitched sound of their wings in flight. Here Terry Redlin treats us to a vivid contrast of color and movement. The horizontal center of warm browns and oranges is essentially static. Cool blues and greys frame this center, and the rushing water and straining Goldeneyes quickly bring the viewer into the scene’s focus of high action.”

SPECIAL MEMORIES ART COLLECTION,F701500289,,"When I was very young my favorite uncle, who was an expert sportsman, taught me how to hunt and fish, Terry Redlin remembers.

Whenever I visited there I spent a lot of time in this magical room. I loved the smells, all the outdoor gear, just the whole atmosphere.""

The illness we hope is minor and, after dispensing both physical and verbal medications, he will return to the warmth and security of his own home.”

The fishing pole is strapped to the buggy before leaving home in the morning. The baskets of produce, barter payment from his morning patients, will provide refreshment for the remainder of the day.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

TWILIGHT TIME ART COLLECTION,F701580089,,"“The long day of hunting is over. The party has returned to the Lakeside Lodge and is inside resting, taking on refreshments and perhaps telling a tall tale or two. The sign nailed to the lodge wall, ‘Last Chance-Inventory,’ informs us that the owner understands what his hunting friends require. After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear. Every sportsman, the lodge owner knows, wants to be ready for the next day.”

HOMETOWN ART COLLECTION,F701249089,,"“This painting captures the romance of a snowy winter night. Two deer have a clear view of the town below the hill. As the smoke from the surrounding chimneys wafts through the evening air, they slowly begin their nightly journey to the cornfield just beyond the bed and breakfast. We can see from the tracks in the snow, that this is their favorite route. The headlights encircling the skating rink tell us that the evening’s entertainment has begun. We can almost hear the muffled laughter and the scraping of skate blades on the ice. Although elements of this painting were inspired by the artist’s hometown, it is a familiar scene in hometowns across America.”

THE LION KING ART COLLECTION,F435390196,,"As I painted my homage to this amazing story, I could not help but be moved by the intricate interplay between all of the magnificent creatures under Simba's domain. I imagined a lush, colorful, and bountiful African plain rightfully reestablished to its splendor after Simba vanquished Scar and his comedic, yet treacherous, hyenas each now forlorn in their punishment. The multitudes of animals have been summoned to pay tribute to Simba's new baby and their future regent as they wait under a spectacular sky illuminated in great anticipation. The world is as it should be&in harmony and perfectly balanced. Simba's heir is exalted by Rafiki and proudly symbolizes what awaits when destiny is embraced, challenges faced, and one summons the courage to stand in the spotlight of providence. I trust that this image will both remind you of this fantastic story and its amazing characters and, most importantly, move you to face the future irrespective of history's impasses knowing that the watchful and approving eye of the King is content as you embrace your place in the circle of life. - Thomas Kinkade

MORNING WARM UP ART COLLECTION,F701375089,,"“Dawn is breaking as the canoe-topped sedan and trailer loaded with decoys chugs up to Leslie's Blacksmith Shop and Sports Store. Earlier arrivals, a friendly combination of farmers in their bib overalls and town folk in fancier outfits, are already warming up around the glowing forge. Terry Redlin fondly remembers scenes such as this from his boyhood. Leslie was a local entrepreneur who expanded his farm into a blacksmith service, then to a cafe wrap-around on his barn, and finally to cabins along the stream for overnight guests. Terry especially recalls the clank of the hammer and pungent aroma of hot metal.”
