MORNING SOLITUDE ART COLLECTION,F701365189,,"“It’s that magical moment in the deep woods when the morning sun first slices through the thick underbrush to cover the landscape with its warm rays. The camper, an early riser, has loaded his fishing gear into the old wooden canoe and with his best buddy is headed out to catch breakfast. A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FALLING IN LOVE ART COLLECTION,F435100096,,"Of all the Disney love stories, perhaps Beauty and the Beast is the most poignant. Beast's true identity is a charming prince who is discovering love in the form of the beautiful Belle. ""Beauty and the Beast Falling in Love"" memorializes that magic moment when they first begin to discover their love for each other. Many of the characters from the movie are present, including Belle's eccentric father Maurice, the wonderful characters of Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and of course, Lumiere.

In the distance, we see the village that is a central setting for many of the film's most important moments. As with every piece in the Disney Dreams Collection, the painting is a panorama portrayal of the entire movie, rather than an individual scene. The viewer's eye is able wander around the painting making discoveries in every corner of the image. The crowning achievement and the central discovery in the image is the sweeping sense of romance that is at the core of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. Here truly is unconditional love in its purest form.

MORNING SOLITUDE ART COLLECTION,F701365189,,"“It’s that magical moment in the deep woods when the morning sun first slices through the thick underbrush to cover the landscape with its warm rays. The camper, an early riser, has loaded his fishing gear into the old wooden canoe and with his best buddy is headed out to catch breakfast. A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”

BACKWOODS CABIN ART COLLECTION,F701125189,,"“Somewhere is that special hideaway that puts us in close touch with the wild. When found, and if we are in the right mood, the roles between man and wildlife are reversed. The experience becomes the opposite of that offered by zoos, where we safely observe from behind a fence of glass. In this place we are surrounded by the grand variety of nature. We sense the myriad wild faces that have come to watch us. But there is no need to be alarmed. The wildlife at this backwoods cabin mean no harm. On this fresh morning, stroll down the steps from the hillside cabin. Sit by the lake, quiet and watchful. One of nature’s wonders, a trio of wood ducks, glide to a landing just across the inlet.”

In this peaceful setting three ring-necked pheasants have found the ideal roost. A long-ago farmer has left his worn out wagon by the side of the road. It is only a skeleton now, but serves as a poignant reminder of people and their dreams passing from the land.”

A HELPING HAND ART COLLECTION,F701305089,,"The artist often witnessed this scene on his great-grandfather's farm. Deep snow has covered most of the available browse and the deer are hungry. Local farmers have constructed a bin down by the creek and are filling it with corn. These farmers never looked for, or expected, publicity or compliments. They simply went out and lent a helping hand to their wildlife neighbors.

"GOOD EVENING, AMERICA! ART COLLECTION",F701280089,,"“Now early autumn, the falling leaves carpet the ground with the colors of the season. The store owner is lowering the flag for the evening and the children are gone now-probably back to school. The dogs are still around, they have learned over the past few months that the store owner has table scraps from the restaurant in his bucket. The sounds of birds chirping and children laughing have been replaced with the quiet rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of water on the shore. It is the end of a peaceful day and the beginning of a whole new season.”

BEST FRIENDS ART COLLECTION,F701130489,,"“At sunset the man and his best friend have driven to the crest of the highest hill around. They've had a good day of hunting in the lakes and marshes below. Now both rest, but the man carefully watches the migrating patterns of the distant waterfowl. Tomorrow he'll have a better idea of where the best hunting will likely be. In this spectacular panorama we see a beautiful slice of rural America. Just follow the winding road past the gas station, then the bait shop, the farms, over the bridge and home to a town with its typical water tower and church steeple.”

AROMA OF FALL ART COLLECTION,F701105689,,"The Aroma Of Fall painting encourages you to pause for a moment and return to a simpler time and place when the aroma of burning leaves in the fall air signaled the changing of seasons. It was a more innocent era before an expanding population created environmental concerns, and when harvesting of summer's foliage was a small town ritual. Careful observers will also see in the Aroma Of Fall painting other faded memories from America's past: the prominent town bulletin board, the flag positioned proudly outside the general store and the familiar Maple Drive and Elm Street. The distinctive lamppost and stone sidewalk tell us this scene is just down the block from Autumn Evening.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/aroma-of-fall-redlin-pinnacle-F701105689d_2000x.jpg?v=1623820179,aroma-of-fall-redlin-pinnacle-F701105689d_2000x.jpg?v=1623820179,,,wildwings800,aroma-of-fall-redlin-pinnacle-F701105689d_2000x.jpg?v=1623820179

After a good night’s rest they will begin their annual journey south. Off in the distance the country church offers a neighborly reminder of who, really, is in charge of nature’s abundant gifts.”
