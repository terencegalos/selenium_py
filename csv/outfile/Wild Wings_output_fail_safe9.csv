There are many stories in this romantic image: the shotgun in the old pickup’s back window, the extra gas tank and a red flag tied high on the antenna. The pole and tree signs tell us there are many people lucky enough to live in this idyllic setting. And, as the moon struggles through a hazy night sky, flights of ducks recognize it's time to head on home for the evening.”

FAMILY TIME ART COLLECTION,F701235089,,"“Three generations of the same family gather together on this spring morning for a relaxed day of fishing. Grandpa, sitting on a discarded wagon tongue, still uses his trusty old cane pole. The grandkids are equipped with new model rods and reels. Dad carefully baits his son’s hook, while the family dog watches intently. It is a special time, a peaceful time, for both young and old to renew a shared kinship in the spectacular beauty of a rural landscape. For this old farmstead to survive, it has become ‘Lakeside Trails,’ a hobby farm catering to horse owners from a nearby city. The land, once planted with corn and wheat, today boards horses and provides beautiful trails through the rolling countryside for the owner’s city neighbors to enjoy.”

LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

NATURE'S SENTINEL ART COLLECTION,F701385089,,"I have often wandered off alone into the woods, Terry Redlin comments, ""and waited very quietly and still in one place for a long period. After a while the birds, squirrels and other small animals have become comfortable with my presence and gone about their normal activities. But when deer have approached, these small creatures would begin to make a racket, sending out a warning that something strange and possibly dangerous was in the area. I've actually experienced this behavior several times. It's a bit eerie but, also, comforting to understand that nature's creatures seem to watch out for each other.""

SUNDAY MORNING ART COLLECTION,F701535389,,"On this serene morning, all of God's creatures are congregating. The humans have arrived in cars and buggies. The deer slowly stir. The cows amble contentedly toward their morning drink. Suddenly, the calf becomes aware of strangers across the stream. In response, the young doe rises, ears alert, and intently watches the intruders approach. After a few moments of mutual inspection, both cows and deer will continue on with their business. High above the steeple, the circling pigeons have been scattered by ringing bells.

O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES ART COLLECTION,F701395089,,"“I have great admiration for those pioneers who left the security of their homes and headed west in covered wagons. So much land, so much sky. A whole new world opened up to them. This picture attempts to capture that sense of adventure and the grandeur of the immense western landscape. As one of the guides inspects a wagon wheel and talks with the driver, a lone eagle soars high overhead, symbolizing a sense of freedom that the young country was experiencing.”

FAMILY TIME ART COLLECTION,F701235089,,"“Three generations of the same family gather together on this spring morning for a relaxed day of fishing. Grandpa, sitting on a discarded wagon tongue, still uses his trusty old cane pole. The grandkids are equipped with new model rods and reels. Dad carefully baits his son’s hook, while the family dog watches intently. It is a special time, a peaceful time, for both young and old to renew a shared kinship in the spectacular beauty of a rural landscape. For this old farmstead to survive, it has become ‘Lakeside Trails,’ a hobby farm catering to horse owners from a nearby city. The land, once planted with corn and wheat, today boards horses and provides beautiful trails through the rolling countryside for the owner’s city neighbors to enjoy.”

CAMPFIRE TALES ART COLLECTION,F701155089,,"As a boy, Terry Redlin listened in awe as his father carefully planned hunting and fishing trips. He never forgot the excitement and wonder of those special times. The homemade camper top on the old pickup is a forerunner of the modern versions. The four deer are secretly watching the activities. Only in the morning will tracks reveal their presence. The man launching the wooden canoe occasionally _x001C_dipped,_x001D_ as we detect from the Copenhagen can vaguely outlined in his rear pocket. And the group's tall storyteller relaxes in a folding chair, hands extended, to recall the big one that got away. As the misty smoke rises to greet the moon we, too, can share in Terry Redlin's unique vision of man's romantic encounter with the wild.

In this spectacular panorama we see a beautiful slice of rural America. Just follow the winding road past the gas station, then the bait shop, the farms, over the bridge and home to a town with its typical water tower and church steeple.”

BATTLING CARIBOU ART COLLECTION,F780059066,,"Mature caribou bulls may be the most handsome of deer. Their snow-white manes and towering antlers cut a striking figure in the barren tundra they call home. But there's a purpose behind those gorgeous manes and incredible racks. Because of the wide open nature of the tundra, caribou are the most visually oriented of the deer species, and a bull's stature is often determined by how large and dominant he appears to other bulls. The caribou rut is also unique, as it takes place when the animals migrate. Hundreds of animals may be moving together, covering many miles a day. This makes rituals like scraping (whitetails) and gathering harems (elk) impossible, so caribou love and fight on the run. Most of the time, the bulls that appear the largest are able to intimidate their rivals. But occasionally, evenly matched bulls will confront each other and a brief but furious shoving match determines dominance.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043,F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043,,,wildwings800,F780059066_2000x.jpg?v=1623819043

The raw-cut lumber piles higher and higher in the open shed. It will be stored here to cure for a while, then delivered to waiting lumberyards in nearby towns. 'The painting was a challenge,' the artist comments, 'because I needed to combine several sources of light. Hopefully the eye moves easily from one area of bustling activity to another.'”
