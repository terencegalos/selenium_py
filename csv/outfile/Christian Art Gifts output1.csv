Amazing Grace Sheet Music Large Wirebound Journal,JLW105,Stationery|Journals|Wirebound,"The Amazing Grace Sheet Music Large Wirebound Journal pays tribute to a hymn that has been cherished for centuries and tells the story of hope and redemption.

The cover design of this wire bound journal is based on the sheet music for the beloved hymn and is accented with green meadows and groupings of brightly colored flowers in shades of pink and red. The first verse of the song penned by John Newton is used as the sentiment. 

 Amazing Grace 

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound 
that saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found; 
was blind, but now I see. 

The journal's back cover is filled with patches of the same bright flowers in a random arrangement. Gold-toned wire binding binds the journal together and suits the design well. Each of the 192 pages in the journal is lined and features a unique Scripture verse that can be used for prayer or reflection. The presentation page can be inscribed with a friends' name and date to celebrate a special occasion. The durable hardcover provides a firm surface for writing, and the wire binding lets you fold over the pages easily. 

The words of the Amazing Grace Sheet Music Large Wirebound Journal will fill your heart with humility as you ponder your salvation. Use the pages to pour out your heart to the Lord in thanksgiving. You may also pair the journal with a bookmark or notebook and share it with a new (or old) believer on their spiritual birthday as a celebratory gift that will be much appreciated.
