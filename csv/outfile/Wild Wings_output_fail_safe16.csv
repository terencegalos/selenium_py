Intently watching from a window, the cat knows that she may soon savor the soft, sweet leftovers from the bottom of an ice cream bowl. This painting captures Terry Redlin's idyllic view of a child's perfect summer evening. According to the artist, 'There is no better treat on a hot summer's night than ice cream!'”
