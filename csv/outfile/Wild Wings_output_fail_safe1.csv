HOMETOWN ART COLLECTION,F701249089,,"“This painting captures the romance of a snowy winter night. Two deer have a clear view of the town below the hill. As the smoke from the surrounding chimneys wafts through the evening air, they slowly begin their nightly journey to the cornfield just beyond the bed and breakfast. We can see from the tracks in the snow, that this is their favorite route. The headlights encircling the skating rink tell us that the evening’s entertainment has begun. We can almost hear the muffled laughter and the scraping of skate blades on the ice. Although elements of this painting were inspired by the artist’s hometown, it is a familiar scene in hometowns across America.”

The sounds of birds chirping and children laughing have been replaced with the quiet rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of water on the shore.

The artist's wife was a member of the Langenfeld family, and the authentic sign is one of the personal touches we sometimes find in Redlin’s work.”

They collect samples of insect populations for signs of new arrivals. In this secluded setting, they learn how to preserve its pristine beauty.
