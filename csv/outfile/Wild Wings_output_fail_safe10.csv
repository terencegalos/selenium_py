As the school bus pulls around the corner, the mother gently tries to coax her young son out of his Radio Flyer, but he doesn’t want to leave the comfort of his mother's arms, the safety of his yard, or his trusted friend, ‘Buddy.’ The youngster will soon take that first step onto the bus, leaving, for the first time, the security of home.”

MOOSE TRACKS SCULPTURE,6567460868,,"The Moose (Alces alces) is commonly believed to be a slow-witted, quick-tempered, clumsy animal with poor vision. His massive size, broadly palmated antlers and long muzzle make him North Americas mightiest and most exotic antlered animal. He is the largest member of the deer family and perfectly suited to life in the worlds boreal forests and wetlands. It stands 6feet tall from shoulders to feet. A male moose can weight as much as 1,600 pounds. The moose has long, thick brown fur. Moose hair is hollow, which helps keep the moose warm. The moose has long legs. Its front legs are longer than itsrear legs. This helps it jump over fallen trees and other forest debris. It has a long head with a large nose and upper lip. It has small ears, a small tail, and a dewlap hanging on its throat. It has powerful shoulder muscles that give it a humpbacked appearance. Of the seven sub-species of moose in the world, four live in North America. The Eastern Moose (Alces alces americana) can be found in the New England states, Alces alces andersoni is found in Minnesota, Michigan and in central Canada, the Alaskan Moose (Alces alces gigas) can be found in Alaska and the Yukon, and Shiras Moose (Alces alces shirasi) which can be found primarily in north western Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, the Colorado Rockies and Southern Canada.

ANTIQUE BARN ORIGINAL ARTWORK ART COLLECTION,F474025096,,"I spent a glorious childhood exploring my family's 92 acres of Pennsylvania woodlands. We lived in a huge eclectic home which had been built around an ancient one room log cabin. The porperty was filled with outbuildings of all sorts and sizes and we were surrounded by large working farmsteads. One nearby farm was no longer fertile enough to support the family, but they simply refused to give up and decided to convert it into an antique auction barn. Thus I like to say that my painting entitled 'Antique Barn' was inspired by the efforts of all hard working Americans who refuse to throw in the towel. I have filled it with humor and nostalgic images. From trucks and tractors to baby carriages, rowboats, wildlife, kids, toys, tools, an antique indian motorcycle and more...literally something for everyone.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

SPRING FEVER ART COLLECTION,F701505089,,"In this delightful image we remember a time when the world was a symphony of youthful shouts, glorious blue skies and secret hideaways in the trees.

CAMPFIRE TALES ART COLLECTION,F701155089,,"As a boy, Terry Redlin listened in awe as his father carefully planned hunting and fishing trips. He never forgot the excitement and wonder of those special times. The homemade camper top on the old pickup is a forerunner of the modern versions. The four deer are secretly watching the activities. Only in the morning will tracks reveal their presence. The man launching the wooden canoe occasionally _x001C_dipped,_x001D_ as we detect from the Copenhagen can vaguely outlined in his rear pocket. And the group's tall storyteller relaxes in a folding chair, hands extended, to recall the big one that got away. As the misty smoke rises to greet the moon we, too, can share in Terry Redlin's unique vision of man's romantic encounter with the wild.

RUSHING RAPIDS ART COLLECTION,F701446889,,"“Three Goldeneyes skim the river’s surface and head upstream looking for quieter water. These birds are commonly known as ‘whistlers’ because of the loud, high pitched sound of their wings in flight. Here Terry Redlin treats us to a vivid contrast of color and movement. The horizontal center of warm browns and oranges is essentially static. Cool blues and greys frame this center, and the rushing water and straining Goldeneyes quickly bring the viewer into the scene’s focus of high action.”

MORNING ROUNDS ART COLLECTION,F701362589,,"“The rural doctor did not work a nine-to-five job. Like the farmers he served, breakfast was before sunup and work already started as morning light broke over the horizon. But a country doctor’s demanding schedule offered clear advantages; the regenerative powers of solitude and nature, regular visits with old friends, and the satisfaction of knowing his efforts were appreciated.”

The fishing pole is strapped to the buggy before leaving home in the morning. The baskets of produce, barter payment from his morning patients, will provide refreshment for the remainder of the day.

BATTLING ELK ART COLLECTION,F780060066,,"The shrill whistle of a bugling bull elk is a classic symbol of the West. Beginning in late summer, the elk rut extends into October. During that time bulls wallow in creeks, springs and small wet depressions, urinate on themselves and bellow challenges. They also assemble harems of cows, a unique behavior in the deer family. A mature bull may gather 20 or more cows and attempt to fend off bulls that try to breed a stray cow while the he isn't looking. Most of these encounters are settled without a fight; but things can turn deadly serious. The two bulls walk parallel and stare each other down. Then one spins in for the attack, and the fight is on. Grunting and heaving, the dueling pair tear up sod as they fight. After many minutes, one bull wins the day, but always at a cost; gouges, scars and punctures are standard for rutting elk. But those wounds are worth it for the right to rule the herd.

GUARDIAN OF CONSERVATION ART COLLECTION,F701287089,,"“It is just before sunset in the fall of the year. The water wheel at the old grist mill is still working although now the rustic building is most often used as a banquet hall. The elusive blue heron keeps a keen eye on the fish at the water’s edge and observes all his surroundings at the same time. Above him geese divert the attention of three Labradors and an Irish setter. As the dogs turn back to watch the heron, he’s gone! The relationship between man and wildlife is one of modern civilization’s continuing dilemmas. The blue heron fishing is a symbol of good ecology. This is proof that the contestants are capable of living in harmony.”

She discovered them hiding behind her toy box. “Come out from there this minute or I shall tell everyone what I have found” she demanded. “Oh please don’t tell anyone about us” the fairies said. If you keep our secret we’ll give you something in return.” “What on earth could a bunch of silly fairies possibly give me?” said the little girl. After thinking for a moment, the tallest fairy proudly said, “We can teach you how to fly!” The fairies made good on their promise and the little girl didn’t have to ride the bus to preschool ever again.

Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

I would be Sheriff Warren of Apache County, out to capture Black Bart or The Sedona Kid being pursued by a gang of ruthless bandits. One summer my cousin Kelsey came to visit. She would climb up behind me on the saddle and join my adventure. I think she called herself something like ‘Six Gun Kate’ and she said she would cover my back from the desperados. The adventure never felt quite right with a girl hanging on my back. I don’t think Sheriff Warren really needed a part time deputy.”

The large Christmas tree will soon be delivered to the nearby church, then gaily decorated for the coming season’s celebrations. Rarely does Terry Redlin create a painting without some hint of surrounding wildlife, and this beautiful image in no exception. Careful observers will note a deserted bird's nest clinging to the inside roof of the bridge. A few months ago swallows called this home.”

The sounds of birds chirping and children laughing have been replaced with the quiet rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of water on the shore.

COMING HOME ART COLLECTION,F701178689,,"In this nostalgic scene 'coming home' becomes a place and a feeling. It speaks to us of a tradition we share, if not in actual fact, then in the values it represents. The Christmas tree has been cut from just down the road. We can imagine the fresh smells of baking bread in the kitchen. The farm house will soon be alive with the joyful sounds of children from two generations. And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.
