SUMMERTIME ART COLLECTION,F701530089,,"“In this nostalgic image Redlin revisits the sunny days of his youth. It was an innocent time when the most important thing in the world was to grab a pail and pole and hike out to the nearest fishing hole. The nearby bait shop offered ample refreshments for young appetites, including Langenfeld ice cream. The artist's wife was a member of the Langenfeld family, and the authentic sign is one of the personal touches we sometimes find in Redlin’s work.”

Intently watching from a window, the cat knows that she may soon savor the soft, sweet leftovers from the bottom of an ice cream bowl. This painting captures Terry Redlin's idyllic view of a child's perfect summer evening. According to the artist, 'There is no better treat on a hot summer's night than ice cream!'”

SUNDAY MORNING ART COLLECTION,F701535389,,"On this serene morning, all of God's creatures are congregating. The humans have arrived in cars and buggies. The deer slowly stir. The cows amble contentedly toward their morning drink. Suddenly, the calf becomes aware of strangers across the stream. In response, the young doe rises, ears alert, and intently watches the intruders approach. After a few moments of mutual inspection, both cows and deer will continue on with their business. High above the steeple, the circling pigeons have been scattered by ringing bells.

MORNING SOLITUDE ART COLLECTION,F701365189,,"“It’s that magical moment in the deep woods when the morning sun first slices through the thick underbrush to cover the landscape with its warm rays. The camper, an early riser, has loaded his fishing gear into the old wooden canoe and with his best buddy is headed out to catch breakfast. A few minutes downstream is a secluded lake, which, in this version of the story, is home to an ample supply of four to five pounders. High in the distant sky a flight of Canadas have also begun their daily search for food. And back near the tree line whitetail deer, a buck and two does, apparently unthreatened by the visitors, quietly observe the action.”

NATURAL CURIOSITY ART COLLECTION,F701380089,,"“All animals are curious. Deer are especially cautious, too. On this quiet summer day, Terry Redlin remembers the behavior of animals he watched in the fields as a kid. The rail fence serves as a protector for both the fawn and the colt, allowing them the safety in which to satisfy their curiosity. The doe, knowing all is well in front, turns her head to watch for predators. Note the small trio of wildflower blooms in the foreground. Nature has found the perfect protected spot for these wayward seeds to flourish.”

Today, his parents could not be more pleased to announce their son's graduation from high school. The car out front is the 'victory car' with the treasured teddy tied to the hood. The bear as well as Buddy, his dog, have been with him every step of the way. The graduate will soon go off to college. The tree house is gone and his 'Private Club' above the garage is all closed up.

HOMETOWN ART COLLECTION,F701249089,,"“This painting captures the romance of a snowy winter night. Two deer have a clear view of the town below the hill. As the smoke from the surrounding chimneys wafts through the evening air, they slowly begin their nightly journey to the cornfield just beyond the bed and breakfast. We can see from the tracks in the snow, that this is their favorite route. The headlights encircling the skating rink tell us that the evening’s entertainment has begun. We can almost hear the muffled laughter and the scraping of skate blades on the ice. Although elements of this painting were inspired by the artist’s hometown, it is a familiar scene in hometowns across America.”

Leslie was a local entrepreneur who expanded his farm into a blacksmith service, then to a cafe wrap-around on his barn, and finally to cabins along the stream for overnight guests. Terry especially recalls the clank of the hammer and pungent aroma of hot metal.”

SNOW WHITE DISCOVERS THE COTTAGE ART COLLECTION,F435715196,,"As a child my imagination was stirred by the great animated films of Walt Disney. Imagine my delight when Disney recently opened their archives to me as I prepared for my first-ever series of images inspired by classic Disney moments.

In the first piece of this series, Snow White's world is alive with color. The Prince's castle where Snow White will eventually discover happiness looms majestically in the distance, while a foaming waterfall and fanciful animals remind us that Snow White is at peace with all of nature. Of course, I also included my iconic colorful flowers which festoon the scene with hopeful reminders of spring.

I hope that Snow White Discovers the Cottage will be a fairy tale come true for Disney and Kinkade collectors everywhere.

TINKER BELL AND PETER PAN FLY TO NEVERLAND ART COLLECTION,F435806696,,"As with the first two paintings in my twelve piece Disney Dreams Collection (affectionately referred to as the ""Disney dozen"" by die hard collectors!), I try to tell the whole story in a single image – what I refer to as a ""narrative panorama"". We see Neverland in the distance, just below the ""second star to the right"", as the full moon bathes the scene with its silvery glow. The lights of London twinkle along the river Thames, as the clouds take shape, if only in our imagination, as characters from the adventure – Captain Hook, Smee, the Lost Boys and the ubiquitous ticking crocodile. But for me, the central character of the story will always remain Tinker Bell, the enchanted fairy princess who makes the entire journey of imagination possible.

As the schoolteacher reads a patriotic passage, the boy behind her has momentarily forgotten which hand is placed over the heart. Standing off to the left, slightly away from the main group, is a boy with his dog. His attention has been distracted by a flight of ducks. As I remember my childhood interests, this just might be something of a self-portrait!”

CAMPING ON SUNSET POINT ART COLLECTION,F701157089,,"“Inspired by an account of a fellow conservationist who came to the aid of baby wood ducks in distress, this painting captures all the elements of the perfect setting. It is early spring and the air is cool as the sun goes down. The deer cautiously move through the trees, keenly aware of the campers, but not threatened by their presence. A new family of wood ducks rests on the warm shoreline rocks. Once again, we are reminded that man and wildlife can co-exist; and thanks to the efforts of conservationists everywhere, we will continue to enjoy this balance in nature.”

HARVEST MEMORIES ART COLLECTION,F701290089,,"“In this colorful image we can almost hear the whir and roar of the old threshing rig, feel the intensity of the crew straining to feed the machine’s voracious appetite, and wonder at the fast growing mountain of golden straw. ‘As a young boy I watched such scenes in awe,’ the artist comments, ‘and noticed that the dust and chaff could be so thick that it almost obscured the sun! This image is also something of a self-portrait because I am the boy pulling the lunch wagon.’ Notice that the kids have more in mind than a day filled with farm chores. Soon they will be off to a nearby lake, pulling the gear-laden wagon appropriately named, ‘Terry’s Fishing Rig.’”

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

But Dad is already preparing for hunting season. Through the window of his workshop we see shotguns out and ready for cleaning. The dogs, anticipating their favorite sport, have scattered the once neatly stacked wooden decoys in the yard. As a trio of mallards wing quietly across the setting sun, only one dog notices. Soon it will be dark and the family will retire to the cabin for supper. With a workshop separate from the main cabin, Mom and Dad each have, in the artist’s words, “their own piece of heaven.”

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.

HARVEST MEMORIES ART COLLECTION,F701290089,,"“In this colorful image we can almost hear the whir and roar of the old threshing rig, feel the intensity of the crew straining to feed the machine’s voracious appetite, and wonder at the fast growing mountain of golden straw. ‘As a young boy I watched such scenes in awe,’ the artist comments, ‘and noticed that the dust and chaff could be so thick that it almost obscured the sun! This image is also something of a self-portrait because I am the boy pulling the lunch wagon.’ Notice that the kids have more in mind than a day filled with farm chores. Soon they will be off to a nearby lake, pulling the gear-laden wagon appropriately named, ‘Terry’s Fishing Rig.’”

BORDER WARS—WHITETAIL DEER ART COLLECTION,1780066065,,"In 1918 a hunter named John Breen took a great buck in the Minnesota northwoods. The 'Breen Buck' would be scored by the Boone & Crocket Club and recognized as the first World Record Typical Whitetail. It would hold that title until it was de-throned in 1971. The deer that knocked the Breen Buck from its top position was taken by Jim Jordan in Wisconsin in 1914, but for years the head and horns were lost. Interestingly, Jordan's buck was taken near the Yellow River; only a few miles from the Minnesota/Wisconsin border. So two of the world record whitetails were taken only 4 years and a short distance apart. The proximity of these two deer in time and distance fosters comparisons and some rivalry between deer hunters of each of the two states. And so with this hunting history in mind, Michael Sieve, loyal to the great state of Minnesota, teamed up with Greg Alexander, passionate resident of Wisconsin, to paint these two great bucks in an epic confrontation along their common border. Each artist attempting to portray his home state's famous buck as the more impressive of the two. Set of three art prints from the Border Wars collaboration by Greg Alexander and Michael Sieve featuring the Minnesota and Wisconsin record bucks.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160,,,wildwings800,border-wars-white-tail-deer-print-sieve-alexander-1780066065_2000x.jpg?v=1623383160

LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”

BATTLING MOOSE ART COLLECTION,F780057068,,"The antlers of an Alaskan bull moose can measure 12 at the base, span six feet or more, and weigh up to 90 pounds. That's some serious headgear, especially when it's resting on the head of an animal standing over six feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 1,400 pounds! Bull moose try to avoid full-blown battles. Even when two prime bulls encounter one another, a bad attitude may be enough to make one animal back down. The pair will trot around, flashing antlers, raking brush and groaning a challenge. They may even rip vegetation from the ground with their mouths, jerking their heads up in a boastful swagger. Often, one of the bulls gives up and wanders off. But if their size and belligerence match, the bulls will clash antlers in a furious shoving match. The ensuing fight is among Nature's most awesome displays. Eventually one bull tires, turns and runs. The victor may slam its monstrous rack into the loser's body or backside as he leaves. His strength and courage have made him king for a day!""

This will be a special Holiday season for them all. In this painting, we are reminded of the peacefulness, the safety, and the comforts of home.”

AROMA OF FALL ART COLLECTION,F701105689,,"The Aroma Of Fall painting encourages you to pause for a moment and return to a simpler time and place when the aroma of burning leaves in the fall air signaled the changing of seasons.

Careful observers will also see in the Aroma Of Fall painting other faded memories from America's past: the prominent town bulletin board, the flag positioned proudly outside the general store and the familiar Maple Drive and Elm Street.

A STUDY IN WHITE—LITTLE GIRL ART COLLECTION,F101705098,,"My Grandmother, Anna Cooper, was given her mother’s wedding dress on her 16th birthday. Anna passed the dress onto my mother and my mother, in turn gave the gown to our daughter Kelsey. Considering that Kelsey was only six years old at the time, my wife suggested that we gently wrap it in tissue and store it safely in the attic. Kelsey, on the other hand, was determined to enjoy her newly inherited treasure to the fullest. Each morning she would ceremoniously don her wedding dress and veil and clomp around the block in her mother’s white heels. She would stop by the Save-Rite Market and accept the warm smiles and flowery compliments from any of our neighbors who happened to be shopping there at that early hour. That summer we referred to her as our dusty hemmed “Study in White!”
