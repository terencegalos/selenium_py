THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER ART COLLECTION,F101652098,,"Annika and Collin were brave kids. Their parents were proud of the fact that nothing, and I mean nothing, could frighten their little soldiers. When Dad took Collin to the barber shop for his first haircut, that boy didn't let out a whimper. Annika got a tetanus shot and never shed a tear. Collin could put a Band-Aid on his skinned knee all by himself and his cousin once pulled a splinter out of her finger with just her teeth. They could both face danger with a steely resolve... but last Friday night, ten minutes into The Mummy Meets the Swamp Thing they lost it; they bolted; terror flowed over them like warm slimy swamp goo on a hideously howling, black-as-a-basement-coal-bin night!

Look closely and you will find the ‘Poker Shack,’ an out-building that was no longer needed for farming, the duck-shaped weather vane on top the old brick silo, and a sign identifying the farmstead as ‘Redlin Farms.’”

A new family of wood ducks rests on the warm shoreline rocks. Once again, we are reminded that man and wildlife can co-exist; and thanks to the efforts of conservationists everywhere, we will continue to enjoy this balance in nature.”

From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss.

From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss.

From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss.

From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss.

From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss.

HIS LAST GOODBYE ART COLLECTION,F701247089,,"The neighborhood is aglow with lights as families prepare for the holiday season. Mom has the tree decorated and lit. From the window, she sees a car slowly pull up to the front walk. She opens the door, expecting to embrace her son, but is horrified to see a representative from the Navy and a Chaplain walking up the steps. Our hearts sink as we realize it is not her son, but the devastating news that he has been killed in war. This painting immerses us in the pain of this American family's ultimate loss. This series is a tribute to the memory of Terry Redlin's brother-in-law and good friend Charles Langenfeld. Charles, a Navy Hospital Corpman, was killed in the Siege of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War in 1968. Like many Americans, Terry's family lives forever with the pain of the ultimate loss.
