LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

BLACK BEAR TRACKS SCULPTURE,6567460675,,"The American Black Bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear native to North America. Though called black bears, they come in a variety of colors andshades including black, brown, cinnamon, grayish, blonde and white. Black bears are usually nocturnal, but can be active during the day. Bears are strong, agile, and quick. They swim, climb trees and can run 30 miles per hour in short bursts. Black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on the season and will include fruit, berries, shoots, bulbs, tubers, buds, catkins, insects, young ungulates, and fish. They typically live in largely forested areas. Bears walk plantigrade meaning they walk with the podials and metatarsals flat on the ground or flat-footed. Black bears have their largest toe to the outside of their feet. Their feet are more robust and rounder, and they have sharp claws. Bears show 5 toes on both front and hind tracks. The claws on both front and hind often show up in the tracks. Bears will usually use the same trails over and over for generations and tend to place their feet in exactly the same place every time they use the trail. Their stride is approximately 36 to 42 in. For such heavy animals, black bears leave very light impressions. Cold cast and realistically hand-painted. Tabletop or wall presentation. Includes education facts on each animal. 10-1/2""H x 9""W x 1-1/2""D.",,,,,,,1,99,,,,,1,wildwings400,wildwings160,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/1821/7782/products/black-bear-track-herrero-mill-creek-6567460675d_2000x.jpg?v=1623819623,black-bear-track-herrero-mill-creek-6567460675d_2000x.jpg?v=1623819623,,,wildwings800,black-bear-track-herrero-mill-creek-6567460675d_2000x.jpg?v=1623819623

And the pole signs in front of the barn tell us there are other farms nearby where similar preparations are underway.

I’d smell the chicken frying and ask Grandpa a baited question that would start him off on one of his stories; those fabulous stories I loved to hear. Years afterward, people would smile and say to me, “IThat Grandpa of yours was, without a doubt, ‘The World’s Greatest Storyteller!’”
