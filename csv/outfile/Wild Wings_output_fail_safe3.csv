SNOW WHITE DISCOVERS THE COTTAGE ART COLLECTION,F435715196,,"As a child my imagination was stirred by the great animated films of Walt Disney. Imagine my delight when Disney recently opened their archives to me as I prepared for my first-ever series of images inspired by classic Disney moments.

The Prince's castle where Snow White will eventually discover happiness looms majestically in the distance, while a foaming waterfall and fanciful animals remind us that Snow White is at peace with all of nature.

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FALLING IN LOVE ART COLLECTION,F435100096,,"Of all the Disney love stories, perhaps Beauty and the Beast is the most poignant. Beast's true identity is a charming prince who is discovering love in the form of the beautiful Belle. ""Beauty and the Beast Falling in Love"" memorializes that magic moment when they first begin to discover their love for each other. Many of the characters from the movie are present, including Belle's eccentric father Maurice, the wonderful characters of Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and of course, Lumiere.

In the distance, we see the village that is a central setting for many of the film's most important moments. As with every piece in the Disney Dreams Collection, the painting is a panorama portrayal of the entire movie, rather than an individual scene. The viewer's eye is able wander around the painting making discoveries in every corner of the image. The crowning achievement and the central discovery in the image is the sweeping sense of romance that is at the core of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. Here truly is unconditional love in its purest form.

My cousin and I would mount our display box on our wagon, put on our best summer dresses and venture out into our neighborhood. We would sell flower and vegetable seeds door to door.

WELCOME TO PARADISE ART COLLECTION,F701585089,,"“The store owner in this backwoods retreat is a true entrepreneur, offering everything a sportsman might need: cane fishing poles, decoys, guns, shells, fuel, refreshments, groceries. While the visiting hunters are inside stocking up, the main action appears overhead as a flock of mallards set their wings in break and flutter down for a night's rest. Notice the pole flag at the rear of the jeep. Personal experience has informed the owner that vehicles left in high grass can be easily misplaced after the day's hunt. Careful observers also will see the tree sign listing the population of Paradise at thirteen. This includes the dog resting in front of the store, but does not imply any bad luck for sportsmen who have found their way to Paradise.”

AND CROWN THY GOOD ART COLLECTION,F701090089,,"“There was something about the opening up of America that seemed to bring out the best in people. It was probably the need to cooperate in building a new way of life from scratch. The holiday season was only the most obvious example of this impulse. Times were slowly getting easier. Electricity had arrived. Automobiles were no longer oddities. And good will extended beyond human neighbors to the wildlife, with corn and a salt lick offered to the curious deer.”

HARVEST MEMORIES ART COLLECTION,F701290089,,"“In this colorful image we can almost hear the whir and roar of the old threshing rig, feel the intensity of the crew straining to feed the machine’s voracious appetite, and wonder at the fast growing mountain of golden straw. ‘As a young boy I watched such scenes in awe,’ the artist comments, ‘and noticed that the dust and chaff could be so thick that it almost obscured the sun! This image is also something of a self-portrait because I am the boy pulling the lunch wagon.’ Notice that the kids have more in mind than a day filled with farm chores. Soon they will be off to a nearby lake, pulling the gear-laden wagon appropriately named, ‘Terry’s Fishing Rig.’”
