LAZY AFTERNOON ART COLLECTION,F701325089,,"“As the geese head for the cornfield behind the farmhouse, only the beating of their wings breaks the silence. The farmer has paused for supper, too, and down at the dock the fishing gear waits for him to try his luck before the sun goes down. Even the pets reflect the slower pace of life on the farm once the chores are done. This absence of activity is temporary, of course. The hunting dogs know that their busy season is approaching, and watch the passing geese with alert anticipation.”

SPRING ON THE GREENS ART COLLECTION,F701520089,,"“The artist’s first golf scene, this image is reminiscent of many courses across the country. The golf bags propped against the tree lead us to believe that two golfers must be off in the woods searching for a missing ball. This hole, almost completely surrounded by water, is a golfer’s greatest challenge. Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

In this spectacular panorama we see a beautiful slice of rural America. Just follow the winding road past the gas station, then the bait shop, the farms, over the bridge and home to a town with its typical water tower and church steeple.”

SUMMERTIME ART COLLECTION,F701530089,,"“In this nostalgic image Redlin revisits the sunny days of his youth. It was an innocent time when the most important thing in the world was to grab a pail and pole and hike out to the nearest fishing hole. The nearby bait shop offered ample refreshments for young appetites, including Langenfeld ice cream. The artist's wife was a member of the Langenfeld family, and the authentic sign is one of the personal touches we sometimes find in Redlin’s work.”

HIS FIRST GRADUATION ART COLLECTION,F701244089,,"It's a proud day. We have watched this boy grow into a young man.

The bear as well as Buddy, his dog, have been with him every step of the way. The graduate will soon go off to college. The tree house is gone and his 'Private Club' above the garage is all closed up. As Mom, Dad, our young man, and his girlfriend pose on the front porch, we see that this is a snapshot from many of our own lives.

Just returned from their southern vacation, they too, will enjoy this season of fresh beginnings.”

CHANGING SEASONS—AUTUMN ART COLLECTION,F701101089,,"For many, autumn is the most thoughtful season of the year.

A great blue heron has made a final surprise visit. A pensive mood permeates the air. As nature slips into low gear, the more reflective among us are reminded of their own changing of the seasons.

NATURAL CURIOSITY ART COLLECTION,F701380089,,"“All animals are curious. Deer are especially cautious, too. On this quiet summer day, Terry Redlin remembers the behavior of animals he watched in the fields as a kid.

The doe, knowing all is well in front, turns her head to watch for predators. Note the small trio of wildflower blooms in the foreground. Nature has found the perfect protected spot for these wayward seeds to flourish.”

EVENING ON THE ICE ART COLLECTION,F701198089,,"“Growing up in eastern South Dakota, I loved to hunt and fish. In the winter, the lakes turned into small towns bustling with activity. One of the best forms of entertainment was ice fishing! Vehicles would drive out to the ‘hot spots’ and while the fishermen would swap stories and unwind from a long work-week, everyone would watch and wait for a bite! Today, it is no different. I look out from my studio and the frozen lake is alive with ice houses, vehicles, and snowmobiles. The enjoyment I get from watching these winter activities inspired this painting.”

HIS FIRST HOMECOMING ART COLLECTION,F701244989,,"“Our young man’s new independence has not overshadowed his deep sense of family. It’s only been a few months since he went away to school but he is homesick. As he pulls up to the snow-packed curb, the neighborhood sleeps. The cat patiently sits by the doorstep as our young man reunites with his dog. Colorfully wrapped packages and a freshly cut evergreen will soon surprise his family. This will be a special Holiday season for them all. In this painting, we are reminded of the peacefulness, the safety, and the comforts of home.”

HOMETOWN ART COLLECTION,F701249089,,"“This painting captures the romance of a snowy winter night. Two deer have a clear view of the town below the hill. As the smoke from the surrounding chimneys wafts through the evening air, they slowly begin their nightly journey to the cornfield just beyond the bed and breakfast. We can see from the tracks in the snow, that this is their favorite route. The headlights encircling the skating rink tell us that the evening’s entertainment has begun. We can almost hear the muffled laughter and the scraping of skate blades on the ice. Although elements of this painting were inspired by the artist’s hometown, it is a familiar scene in hometowns across America.”

Soon the geese will disrupt this basic training and the controlled practice session will erupt into uncontrollable chaos.

As in many Redlin paintings we find specific reminders of his boyhood. The artist owns and continues to use an old six-horse Evinrude outboard. Back in those days, it was legal to fish from two lines.

BASIC TRAINING ART COLLECTION,F701127089,,"As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, it casts an amber glow across the land. Three generations gather on the end of the dock for one of many training sessions with their trusted hunting companions. As the young pup leaps off of the dock to retrieve, the older dogs watch and wait their turn—all but the oldest lab. He hears the robins squawking and is alerted to the geese flying overhead. This practice session is of no interest to him after years of retrieving with his master. Soon the geese will disrupt this basic training and the controlled practice session will erupt into uncontrollable chaos.

BATTLING MULE DEER ART COLLECTION,F780058065,,"Young mule bucks spar frequently and the sessions teach them quickly how to gauge another buck's virility just by looking at his antlers, body size, and attitude. It's a valuable skill, one that saves many bucks from serious injury or death. A mature mule deer buck is an impressive animal who can weigh up to 350 pounds and have heavy, sprawling antlers nearly three feet wide. Like the bucks in this painting, many mule deer fights take place on steep ground, and the buck who uses his strength and the terrain to his advantage is often the winner - sometimes knocking his opponent off his feet or even flipping him on his back. If the loser can't regain his footing and flee, the victor will gouge him with his heavy antlers, ripping his ear, tearing his hide, even impaling his rib cage. While usually short, mule deer fights have the potential to be deadly!

WELCOME TO PARADISE ART COLLECTION,F701585089,,"“The store owner in this backwoods retreat is a true entrepreneur, offering everything a sportsman might need: cane fishing poles, decoys, guns, shells, fuel, refreshments, groceries.

Notice the pole flag at the rear of the jeep. Personal experience has informed the owner that vehicles left in high grass can be easily misplaced after the day's hunt. Careful observers also will see the tree sign listing the population of Paradise at thirteen. This includes the dog resting in front of the store, but does not imply any bad luck for sportsmen who have found their way to Paradise.”

NATURE'S SENTINEL ART COLLECTION,F701385089,,"I have often wandered off alone into the woods, Terry Redlin comments, ""and waited very quietly and still in one place for a long period. After a while the birds, squirrels and other small animals have become comfortable with my presence and gone about their normal activities. But when deer have approached, these small creatures would begin to make a racket, sending out a warning that something strange and possibly dangerous was in the area. I've actually experienced this behavior several times. It's a bit eerie but, also, comforting to understand that nature's creatures seem to watch out for each other.""

The only witnesses to this transition are the calmly feeding pheasants.”

SHORELINE NEIGHBORS ART COLLECTION,F701480289,,"“The human inhabitants who live in this location have taken special efforts to welcome the arriving wildlife. The gentle, meandering stream offers a natural haven for visiting waterfowl, but these two Canadian honkers have discovered an unusual and ideal nesting spot. Conservationists have placed a tightly rolled hay bale at water's edge. The bale was donated by a local farmer and was carefully spotted on the ice during the previous winter. As spring arrived and the ice melted, the bale dropped into its appointed place. Such innovative thinking is a beautiful example of how man and nature are working together to become good 'Shoreline Neighbors.'”

After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear.
