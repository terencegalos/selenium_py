SACD,"Brazos™ Straight Aromatic Cedar Walking Stick
The Straight Aromatic Cedar Walking Stick is handcrafted from aromatic cedar, making it one of the most attractive straight sticks in our line. Its red and purple hues coupled with cream-colored sapwood swirl beautifully down this staff. To bolster its stability, we make the Straight Aromatic Cedar Walking Stick from three pieces of 3/8-inch, laminated aromatic cedar boards. Please note that cedar is not a hardwood and tends to be softer than most woods and can dent or scratch easier. The Straight Aromatic Cedar Walking Stick comes in one of four sizes: 41-inches (primarily a child's size""), 48-inches, 55-inches, and 58-inches. The staff also comes with a standard rubber ferrule for a firm, secure grip on virtually any surface.

The lacquer helps to bring out the wood’s intrinsic beauty and transforms a mere root into something you’ll be proud to call your own.

BBS,"Brazos™ Brass Spike
The Brazos™ Brass Spike concept was developed in house, after years of selling other excellent spike ferrules: the Lee Valley Spike, the Spike Ferrule, and the Combi Spike. The idea was to offer our customers a quality spike, in the same vein as the venerable Lee Valley Spike, but at a lower price point. The result is this rugged brass spike coupled with a premium quality, removable rubber ferrule. Spike ferrules are useful for going ""off road"" with your walking stick, where you may need extra ""grip"" on rocky terrain, uneven footing, snow, and even ice. Please note, unlike the Lee Valley Spike, the Brazos™ Brass Spike's pointed end is not removable. The premium rubber ferrule that comes standard with the Brazos™ Brass Spike, is ideal for most walking situations. It offers a firm, secure grip on just about any surface, while protecting the brass spike until it's ready for use. Finally, the Brazos™ Brass Spike, attached to a handcrafted Brazos Walking Stick, is an ideal gift, as it offers both utility and distinct style.

STSM,"To size a ferrule correctly you'll need to measure the exact diameter of the bottom of your walking stick or walking cane. The size of the stick diameter should correspond roughly to the size of the ferrule you will need. Keep in mind, these rubber tips are somewhat pliable (a good thing!), so if the ferrule opening is slightly smaller than the diameter of the bottom of your cane or stick, you'll be just fine -- it'll stretch to accommodate the difference. It's better to get a slightly smaller ferrule for your needs, than a slightly larger one.

  All rubber isn’t created equally. Most drug store, discount rubber tips (ferrules) are made with an excess of clay mixed with rubber, the result is a cheap cane/stick tip that will wear out within a couple of weeks of extensive use.

Our premium rubber ferrules are just that, premium. The high quality rubber used to make our walking stick ferrules will last for months under normal use, and even years if used sporadically. If used for step by step support, you can expect our premium ferrules to last at least two to three months, but “mileage” will vary depending on walking conditions.

Our rubber ferrules have a wide grip, allowing more of the ground to be grasped while you’re walking, thus offering superior support. Furthermore, our ferrules all have a metal washer inside, thus offering even more support and stability which will, in turn, allow the ferrule to last longer. Low quality ferrules do not have metal washers inside of them.

Best of all, our premium rubber ferrules come standard on all of our walking sticks (unless an upgraded spike option is chosen). ",http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server5600/7fd49/products/2276/images/5978/rubber_ferrule__99527.1337366680.1280.1280.jpg?c=2

Premium quality rubber tip for walking sticks and walking canes.
1.0625"" hole diamater.
FREE SHIPPING ON THIS ITEM.
To size a ferrule correctly you'll need to measure the exact diameter of the bottom of your walking stick or walking cane. The size of the stick diameter should correspond roughly to the size of the ferrule you will need. Keep in mind, these rubber tips are somewhat pliable (a good thing!), so if the ferrule opening is slightly smaller than the diameter of the bottom of your cane or stick, you'll be just fine -- it'll stretch to accommodate the difference. It's better to get a slightly smaller ferrule for your needs, than a slightly larger one.
All rubber isn’t created equally. Most drug store, discount rubber tips (ferrules) are made with an excess of clay mixed with rubber, the result is a cheap cane/stick tip that will wear out within a couple of weeks of extensive use. Our premium rubber ferrules are just that, premium. The high quality rubber used to make our walking stick ferrules will last for months under normal use, and even years if used sporadically. If used for step by step support, you can expect our premium ferrules to last at least two to three months, but “mileage” will vary depending on walking conditions. Our rubber ferrules have a wide grip, allowing more of the ground to be grasped while you’re walking, thus offering superior support. Furthermore, our ferrules all have a metal washer inside, thus offering even more support and stability which will, in turn, allow the ferrule to last longer. Low quality ferrules do not have metal washers inside of them. Best of all, our premium rubber ferrules come standard on all of our walking sticks (unless an upgraded spike option is chosen).

STME,"***About 50% of all our walking sticks accept this Medium size. However, it's best to check your measurement using the method below.***
To size a ferrule correctly you'll need to measure the exact diameter of the bottom of your walking stick or walking cane. The size of the stick diameter should correspond roughly to the size of the ferrule you will need. Keep in mind, these rubber tips are somewhat pliable (a good thing!), so if the ferrule opening is slightly smaller than the diameter of the bottom of your cane or stick, you'll be just fine -- it'll stretch to accommodate the difference. It's better to get a slightly smaller ferrule for your needs, than a slightly larger one.

All rubber isn’t created equally. Most drug store, discount rubber tips (ferrules) are made with an excess of clay mixed with rubber, the result is a cheap cane/stick tip that will wear out within a couple of weeks of extensive use.

Our premium rubber ferrules are just that, premium. The high quality rubber used to make our walking stick ferrules will last for months under normal use, and even years if used sporadically. If used for step by step support, you can expect our premium ferrules to last at least two to three months, but “mileage” will vary depending on walking conditions.

Our rubber ferrules have a wide grip, allowing more of the ground to be grasped while you’re walking, thus offering superior support. Furthermore, our ferrules all have a metal washer inside, thus offering even more support and stability which will, in turn, allow the ferrule to last longer. Low quality ferrules do not have metal washers inside of them.

Best of all, our premium rubber ferrules come standard on all of our walking sticks (unless an upgraded spike option is chosen). ",http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server5600/7fd49/products/2277/images/5979/rubber_ferrule__53909.1337366689.1280.1280.jpg?c=2
