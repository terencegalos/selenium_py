Revive and Rejoice
Really, what’s better than the smell of a fresh-baked scone? How ‘bout the smell of a fresh-baked scone combined with the zippy tartness of lemon zest? That’d be our answer, which is just what this particular version of Crush On You (our rave-reviewed handmade sugar scrub) smells like.
It smells so nice, in fact, that it almost doesn’t matter that it also scrubs cleaner than anything we’ve ever tried while leaving you perfectly moisturized. Except that, of course, it does matter. Because Crush On You is more than a sugar scrub. We combine pure sugar with unrefined shea butter, rice bran oil and our imported pH-balanced soap to deliver a unique exfoliating-moisturizing-cleansing experience that has the texture of warm, fresh cookie batter, not a soupy, oily pool of sugar.
Great in the shower, in the kitchen (though we make a kitchen-specific soapy sugar scrub, Chef’s Scrub, too), in the bath and on kids that have decided laundry markers make great fake-tattoo application devices (don’t ask how we know).
Crush On You sugar scrubs are naturally colored using FDA-approved cosmetic grade mica, which is mined and crushed into a fine power. No heavy metals (or parabens, or phthalates, or petroleum products, or animal products) are present, ever.

Own the Room - Run the Bath
Sun-ripened ruby red grapefruits, freshly squeezed, served in a Baccarat goblet, garnished with black orchid. Sound good? We think so too, and that image informed the design of our Ruby Rock Star fragrance, one of our most popular.
But the fragrance just sets the stage for the rock star version of Crush On You, our handmade sugar scrub. As with the other scents, Ruby Rock Star delivers an amazing exfoliating experience (thanks, sugar) as well as deep moisturizing regardless of how often you bathe with it (gracias, rice bran oil and unrefined shea butter), and a clean, grease-free finish (domo arigato, Mr. Rosoapo).
Great for use at every sink, tub and shower in the house, it's effective on every body part from foot to face. Plus, we hear its ability to remove sharpie ink from autograph-signing finger tips (and to clean groupie cooties from rock star heiny) is without peer.
So feel free to party like a rock star – we’ll help clean up the mess.
PS: We also make both a perfume and a handmade Pop Soap in the same Ruby Rock Star scent, so you can live large no matter what you're doing.

Fresh and Floral - Vibrant and Sexy
Regularly topping our sugar scrub best seller chart (we’re speaking figuratively here: we don’t actually have charts hanging on walls) Sexy Laundry Day is one of those scents that we have no intention of discontinuing (if for no other reason than to avoid angering certain possibly over-zealous fans of the scent). But why is it so popular? Maybe the woman who named Crush On You, way back when it was first created it, can explain it.
“The scent makes me start singing ‘Fly Me To The Moon’ in the shower,” she says. Wait, what? Back-story: the woman to whom we’re referring (we’ll call her Ethelwyn for the purposes of this narrative) is a close relative of Absolute Soap's original co-founders Joanna and Bradford Schmidt. While debating various names for their new handmade sugar scrub, Ethelywn turned to Joanna and said she loved it so much it made her start singing the song “I’ve Got A Crush On You.” Sensing a theme here? Yeah, she’s a lifelong Sinatra fan. We think maybe she relates everything to Ol’ Blue Eyes.
So let’s just say it’s the fresh, vibrant floral scent that makes it so popular. Rosewood, musk, baby rose, jasmine and more (we can’t give away all our secrets now, can we?) make it unique among floral fragrance blends. Combine that magic with our amazing hand-blended sugar, shea butter, rice bran oil and pH-balanced soap scrub and you’ve got something really special. And while we can’t guarantee that it’s Sexy Laundry Day Crush On You that keeps Ethelwyn still globe-hopping, able to toss back dirty martinis like a sailor and breeze through the NY Times crossword in no time at all, it can’t hurt, either.
Sexy Laundry Day: Great with any Sinatra song at all.

First The Soap - Now The Scrub
We're not going to kid you: we wouldn't complain if we were rich. I mean, maybe about how tough it is to find a good Ferrari mechanic, but other than that, we'd be good. But since we don't think we'll be joining the ranks those who can snap up mansions on Palm Beach like hungry hungry hippos snap up those marbles any time soon, it looks like we'll just have to pretend. And once we're in the shower with Palm Beach Illustrated Crush On You (or soap), pretending gets a whole lot easier.
Originally created at the request of Palm Beach Illustrated Magazine to celebrate their 60th anniversary, Palm Beach Illustrated became an instant best-selling soap. Understandable we suppose, as the soap is gorgeous. But it's not just about the look. As Lynyrd Skynyrd famously said: ""ooh-ooh that smell"" (no, this doesn't smell like... that - but the sentiment is the same).
It's a blend of blooming lily, ripe cantaloupe and sugarcane. Just the sort of combo that might waft from the gardens of beachfront homes in Palm Beach. And after many, many requests, we've released a Crush On You in this magical scent. It's beautiful, it's balanced, it's delightful.
Palm Beach Illustrated Crush On You sugar scrub: Scrub it like a Trump. We have no idea what that means either.

Our Compliments to the Chef
We love to cook. What we don’t love is cleaning: pots and pans or stubbornly fishy post-tuna-salad-making hands. We still don’t have a great solution to offer you on the pots and pans issue (though we recommend having a teenager or two around that wants to be able to go out on Friday night), but we’ve got the perfect handmade scrubby soap answer for your hands: Chef’s Scrub.
We’re well aware that keeping hands soft while scrubbing them clean isn’t easy, but Chef’s Scrub does the job. At its heart, it’s a handmade sugar scrub. But when you take a sugar scrub and combine it with pH-balanced soap, unrefined shea butter and fresh, high quality rice bran oil (as we do with all varieties of Crush On You), then add a helping of ground coffee (which is exclusive to Chef’s Scrub), you get something bigger, better and kinder to your hands.
The great lemon and black pepper scent helps cut the smell of garlic, fish, or whatever other delicious (if perhaps smelly) foods you’ve been working with, while the sugar scrubs your skin clean. Then the shea butter and oils jump in, moisturizing your skin and keeping it from drying out no matter how often you wash up. Finally, the imported cleanser rinses it all off clean as a whistle. That ground coffee we add super-charges the entire experience.
So stop worrying and start enjoying the cook. When you’re done, Chef’s Scrub will remove residual oils and other nasties, neutralize odors from potent foods, and leave your hands clean, smelling sweet and super soft.

Deep. Dark. Sexy.

Mazu Perfume,"
HomePerfumeMazu Perfume

Go East
It began in Siam, sometime in the 16th century: the story went that walking silently through a particular royal flower garden by moonlight, then kneeling by a stream and drinking a very specific beverage from a coconut shell would bring love, happiness and calm to anyone with an open heart. The drink was made by a single family that lived near the gardens, from a recipe kept secret and passed down mother to daughter for generations (the men in the family were kept in the dark). It was free for anyone that wished to make the walk.
After decades of turning a blind eye to people walking through the royal gardens at night, Rama I, who became the first monarch of the House of Chakri after deposing King Taksin (who was said to be insane) made them public in the hope that love and happiness would spread among the people. The gardens remained public even after 1932 when Siam became Thailand, a constitutional, not absolute, monarchy.
The family still makes the drink, and still hold its secrets close. However, some ingredients are known to be in the recipe, and we’ve included them in our magical Mazu hand-blended perfume.
Lemongrass, coconut milk, blackened vanilla and Indonesian lime leaves are combined with whispers of clove, jasmine and dark musk and become a complex and magical scent that will transport you to a 21st century Thai beach or a 16th century Siamese palace. A truly unique and wonderful scent.
Mazu hand-blended perfume: love, happiness and calm in a bottle. Even if we did make that story up (the king parts are true though!).

Expressed Lime Oil from the West Indies
A cold cocktail on a hot beach, fresh lime shaken with sparkling club soda. We find freshly squeezed lime juice so evocative that a new soap was called for: one that would transport any shower, anywhere, to a breezy oasis by the ocean. So we brought in a ton of lime essential oils (fragrance oils just wouldn’t work for what we wanted, and we wanted this to be in our all natural soap group). Some oils were just weak, while others smelled more like candy than lime due to the process of extracting the oil. Some just didn’t seem limey. And then, after weeks of testing, we found it:
A pure, expressed West Indian lime that you’d swear is fresh squeezed right into the bottle. In fact, it’s so lime-powered that it tints the soap green. That’s right, we don’t use any colorants in Lime Smash soap at all, we just let the essential lime oil do its work and give Lime Smash a real-lime kick.
A wonderful wake-up soap, Lime Smash is also great in a before-heading-out-on-the-town shower, reviving and exciting you for the evening to come (though we cannot be responsible for any uncontrollable margarita cravings it causes.)
Lime Smash handmade soap: a happy place where warm winds blow and work is a distant memory.

A Beach Scene in Soap
When Absolute Soap was asked to design a special handmade soap to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Palm Beach Illustrated magazine, previous owners Brad and Joanna definitely succeeded in creating a soap that would represent the area, both in look and fragrance.
The design evokes warm ocean water gently washing onto a shell-covered beach. The lower portion is made with finely ground oatmeal which adds both visual and tactile texture to the soap, providing light exfoliation. The blue-green color, combined with the miniature chunks of white soap, create an abstract replica of the wonderful waters in Palm Beach County. Every bar is topped off with glitter: a fancy bit of bling after a relaxing day at the beach.
A magical blend of ripened cantaloupe, fragrant blooming lily and honeyed sugarcane juice give the scent just the right amount of tropical magic. It’s a perfectly balanced fragrance that’s fresh, clean and wildy popular, continuously selling out both online and in retail locations. We are extremely pleased to count it among our Absolute Pop Soaps.

Wait… was that a bit over-the-top? Maybe we did go a bit overboard with the theatrics, but give us a break: we’re trying to make a point here:
That Sexy Laundry Day is a fresh, clean and unique floral scent with a hint of sexiness that makes this handmade soap like none other. And sure, we could have said it that way, but then where would the drahhhma be, dah-ling?
And Sexy Laundry Day soap deserves a bit of drama, because it’s got something that ordinary floral scents lack: the magical sense of the outdoors captured by cottons dried on a line combined with a sexy, flowery high note that will have you feeling like a ‘50s bombshell.
It’s a unique blend of fragrances that explains why this soap (as well as the Sexy Laundry Day version of Crush On You), have been perennial best-sellers around here; a scent that we won’t be dropping any time soon (because we’re not too keen on the idea of getting chased by the villagers).

Spearmint & Lemongrass with Activated Coconut Charcoal
This is no ordinary mint soap because, among other things, there’s no peppermint to be found anywhere in the ingredients. Don’t get us wrong: it’s not that we don’t like peppermint. It’s just that it can get a bit… scary on some body parts.
So we’ve gone in a different direction with U.S. Mint and created an all natural mint soap that’s not too harsh, not too mellow and not too I'm-standing-on-a-mountain-in-winter. U.S. Mint is unique, fresh and smooth.
Spearmint, lemongrass and eucalyptus essential oils combine to makes U.S. Mint a wonderful surprise, like walking through a Thai mint garden covered in soap suds. It’s a great wake-up scent that incredibly works as a nighttime wind-down soap as well.
Ingredients like matcha green tea and activated coconut charcoal make U.S. Mint even more unique: coconut charcoal is said to draw toxins and impurities out of the skin, helping to relieve acne and other skin problems, while green teas contain high amounts of antioxidants and can rejuvenate dead skin cells. Matcha green tea specifically has a high concentration of vitamin C, which is important to the maintenance of good skin tone.
Bonus: The French green clay we use as a colorant is revered for its ability to help remove dead skin cells, absorb impurities and fats, and tone and strengthen connective tissues. Talk about a fresh-maker...
U.S. Mint handmade soap: not your grandparents’ box-o-mints.

Smoky Clovey Woodsy
Slide into your suede fringe jacket and bell-bottom jeans. Turn up the 8-track and light a clove. Déjà Vu handmade soap will transport you back to an era of brown cars and orange shirts, single-screen movie theaters and answering machines, No Nukes concerts and Frisbees. A simpler, cell phone and Facebook-free time filled with free love, great music and seed-cleanin' gatefold albums.
Déjà Vu soap has notes of wood, spice, sweet clove and smoke, then finishes with a hit of swirled chocolate (it's unsweetened cocoa that makes those groovy swirls, man). What more can you ask for? It’s comforting as a down vest, cool as an afro, fun as a high school ski trip, evocative as a CK jeans ad, psychedelic as Laserium, and mellow as Wish You Were Here. Yeah, all at once.
Déjà Vu’s heady blend of essential oils (including cedarwood, fir needle, clove and orange) are a perfect and complex powerhouse that will trip fond-memory flashbacks or set the mood for new ones. It’s a spicy-sweet, smoky-clove handmade soap that’s as unique and fascinating as that magical person from lit class that you couldn’t stop thinking of, but never said a word to.
Déjà Vu handmade soap: wash up, get down, then pass it on.

Face the Black Beauty
Activated coconut charcoal and kaolin clay are known to help draw toxins from the skin, helping to clean and restore health.
Adzuki bean powder and bamboo extract are gentle, all-natural cleansers that are found in many Japanese skincare regimens and they give DETOX, a wonderful light scrubbiness.
Eucalyptus, tea tree, anise and clove essential oils do far more than just provide a great scent: clove has antioxidant, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties, while the other three are naturally antiseptic. Suitable for all skin types, DETOX is a wonderful and unique soap.

Own the Room - Run the Bath
Sun-ripened ruby red grapefruits, freshly squeezed, served in a Baccarat goblet, garnished with black orchid. Sound good? We think so too, and that image informed the design of our Ruby Rock Star fragrance, one of our most popular.
But the fragrance just sets the stage for the rock star version of Crush On You, our handmade sugar scrub. As with the other scents, Ruby Rock Star delivers an amazing exfoliating experience (thanks, sugar) as well as deep moisturizing regardless of how often you bathe with it (gracias, rice bran oil and unrefined shea butter), and a clean, grease-free finish (domo arigato, Mr. Rosoapo).
Great for use at every sink, tub and shower in the house, it's effective on every body part from foot to face. Plus, we hear its ability to remove sharpie ink from autograph-signing finger tips (and to clean groupie cooties from rock star heiny) is without peer.
So feel free to party like a rock star – we’ll help clean up the mess.
PS: We also make both a perfume and a handmade Pop Soap in the same Ruby Rock Star scent, so you can live large no matter what you're doing.

A Beach Scene in Soap
When Absolute Soap was asked to design a special handmade soap to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Palm Beach Illustrated magazine, previous owners Brad and Joanna definitely succeeded in creating a soap that would represent the area, both in look and fragrance.
The design evokes warm ocean water gently washing onto a shell-covered beach. The lower portion is made with finely ground oatmeal which adds both visual and tactile texture to the soap, providing light exfoliation. The blue-green color, combined with the miniature chunks of white soap, create an abstract replica of the wonderful waters in Palm Beach County. Every bar is topped off with glitter: a fancy bit of bling after a relaxing day at the beach.
A magical blend of ripened cantaloupe, fragrant blooming lily and honeyed sugarcane juice give the scent just the right amount of tropical magic. It’s a perfectly balanced fragrance that’s fresh, clean and wildy popular, continuously selling out both online and in retail locations. We are extremely pleased to count it among our Absolute Pop Soaps.
Palm Beach Illustrated handmade soap: you may not be a Kennedy, but you can bathe like one.
