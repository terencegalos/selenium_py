TWILIGHT TIME ART COLLECTION,F701580089,,"“The long day of hunting is over. The party has returned to the Lakeside Lodge and is inside resting, taking on refreshments and perhaps telling a tall tale or two. The sign nailed to the lodge wall, ‘Last Chance-Inventory,’ informs us that the owner understands what his hunting friends require. After many years of use, the tree has become the official place to stack guns, hang out wet clothing and repack shells and other gear. Every sportsman, the lodge owner knows, wants to be ready for the next day.”

NATURE'S SENTINEL ART COLLECTION,F701385089,,"I have often wandered off alone into the woods, Terry Redlin comments, ""and waited very quietly and still in one place for a long period. After a while the birds, squirrels and other small animals have become comfortable with my presence and gone about their normal activities. But when deer have approached, these small creatures would begin to make a racket, sending out a warning that something strange and possibly dangerous was in the area. I've actually experienced this behavior several times. It's a bit eerie but, also, comforting to understand that nature's creatures seem to watch out for each other.""

LIGHTS OF HOME ART COLLECTION,F701335089,,"In many ways small towns are alike. One of the most common similarities is the big house on the hill. On the highest point of land lives the town's banker, doctor, pioneer land owner or other prominent person. Often this residence is an active social center for the community. Such a story is recounted in this painting. All the lights in the big house have been turned on, a sign of welcome for arriving guests. The dog knows from experience that when this happens company is expected, and he waits on the road with anticipation. The romantic spell of this cold and hazy evening is intensified by the glowing lights, and we can be readily transported back to an era when one took the time to get to know their neighbors.

SUNDAY MORNING ART COLLECTION,F701535389,,"On this serene morning, all of God's creatures are congregating. The humans have arrived in cars and buggies. The deer slowly stir. The cows amble contentedly toward their morning drink. Suddenly, the calf becomes aware of strangers across the stream. In response, the young doe rises, ears alert, and intently watches the intruders approach. After a few moments of mutual inspection, both cows and deer will continue on with their business. High above the steeple, the circling pigeons have been scattered by ringing bells.

NATURAL CURIOSITY ART COLLECTION,F701380089,,"“All animals are curious. Deer are especially cautious, too. On this quiet summer day, Terry Redlin remembers the behavior of animals he watched in the fields as a kid.

The doe, knowing all is well in front, turns her head to watch for predators. Note the small trio of wildflower blooms in the foreground. Nature has found the perfect protected spot for these wayward seeds to flourish.”

Out of the view of the golfers, the Canadian honkers and goslings are accustomed to swimming among the misdirected golf balls.”

PREPARED FOR THE SEASON ART COLLECTION,F701435089,,"We see that hunting and fishing activities have been a tradition with this farm family. Three deer racks decorate the barn wall. Beneath, the fishing boat and canoe patiently wait for spring. But today attention is on the opening of duck season. Equipment reclaimed from annual hibernation has been checked, cleaned and rechecked. The Dodge pickup is loaded with a homemade duck boat and wooden decoys. Two favorite shotguns stand guard at the cab door. Last minute plans are reviewed in the nearby shed. Then, as if to officially signal both the beginning of an annual ritual and the end of a truce, three mallards break the still air in a final flyby.

BASIC TRAINING ART COLLECTION,F701127089,,"As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, it casts an amber glow across the land. Three generations gather on the end of the dock for one of many training sessions with their trusted hunting companions. As the young pup leaps off of the dock to retrieve, the older dogs watch and wait their turn—all but the oldest lab. He hears the robins squawking and is alerted to the geese flying overhead. This practice session is of no interest to him after years of retrieving with his master. Soon the geese will disrupt this basic training and the controlled practice session will erupt into uncontrollable chaos.

AFTER HOURS-DEER SHACK LIMITED EDITION PRINT,1018010065,,"'After Hours' is based on a story that takes place every year as the deer hunting season puts mankind in deer country. Deer at that point go into a more nocturnal pattern.

BORDER WARS—WHITETAIL DEER ART COLLECTION,1780066065,,"In 1918 a hunter named John Breen took a great buck in the Minnesota northwoods. The 'Breen Buck' would be scored by the Boone & Crocket Club and recognized as the first World Record Typical Whitetail. It would hold that title until it was de-throned in 1971. The deer that knocked the Breen Buck from its top position was taken by Jim Jordan in Wisconsin in 1914, but for years the head and horns were lost. Interestingly, Jordan's buck was taken near the Yellow River; only a few miles from the Minnesota/Wisconsin border. So two of the world record whitetails were taken only 4 years and a short distance apart. The proximity of these two deer in time and distance fosters comparisons and some rivalry between deer hunters of each of the two states. And so with this hunting history in mind, Michael Sieve, loyal to the great state of Minnesota, teamed up with Greg Alexander, passionate resident of Wisconsin, to paint these two great bucks in an epic confrontation along their common border. Each artist attempting to portray his home state's famous buck as the more impressive of the two.

FAMILY TIME ART COLLECTION,F701235089,,"“Three generations of the same family gather together on this spring morning for a relaxed day of fishing. Grandpa, sitting on a discarded wagon tongue, still uses his trusty old cane pole. The grandkids are equipped with new model rods and reels. Dad carefully baits his son’s hook, while the family dog watches intently. It is a special time, a peaceful time, for both young and old to renew a shared kinship in the spectacular beauty of a rural landscape. For this old farmstead to survive, it has become ‘Lakeside Trails,’ a hobby farm catering to horse owners from a nearby city. The land, once planted with corn and wheat, today boards horses and provides beautiful trails through the rolling countryside for the owner’s city neighbors to enjoy.”

The barbed wire in the rack, the broken tine, the bullet hole in a brow point, and all the rest are real injuries a wild buck could experience.
