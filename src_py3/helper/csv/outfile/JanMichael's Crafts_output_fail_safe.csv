Nutty Praline,1DRAMPONPN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Caramelized Sugar, Sea Salt Middle: Butter, Praline, Pecan, Brown Sugar, Hazelnut Base: Caramel, Vanilla, Tonka Bean Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting.

Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting. UV Lighting may cause discoloration to the oil wax blend but does not effect the integrity of the product.",,,,,,,2,99,,,,,2,JanMichael400,JanMichael160,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-wb4uepr7/images/stencil/500x659/products/24520/73422/masbbm__19514.1687369680.jpg,masbbm__19514.1687369680.jpg,,,JanMichael800,masbbm__19514.1687369680.jpg,

Blueberry Crumb Cake,1DRAMPOBCC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Butter, Sugar Middle: Blueberry Base: Vanilla, Graham Cracker Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Blueberry Crumb Cake,1DRAMPOBCC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Butter, Sugar Middle: Blueberry Base: Vanilla, Graham Cracker Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting. UV Lighting may cause discoloration to the oil wax blend but does not effect the integrity of the product.",,,,,,,2,99,,,,,2,JanMichael400,JanMichael160,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-wb4uepr7/images/stencil/500x659/products/24524/73427/masblt__41621.1687375011.jpg,masblt__41621.1687375011.jpg,,,JanMichael800,masblt__41621.1687375011.jpg,

This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Citron & Mandarin,1DRAMPOCAM,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Grapefruit, Lemon, Mandarin Middle: Orange, Peach, Guava, Tangerine, Clementine Base: Bright Musk, Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Caramel Butter Cream,1DRAMPOCBC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Caramel, Condensed Milk Middle: Sea Salt, Brown Sugar, Butter Base: Vanilla, Soft Musk Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Christmas Tree,1DRAMPOCTR,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Apple Middle: Pine Base: Cedar, Fir, Cypress Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Dirty Chai,1DRAMPODCH,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Almond, Caramel, Honey Middle: Cardamom, Clove, Cinnamon, Tobacco, Anise Base: Tonka Bean, Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Dirty Chai,1DRAMPODCH,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Almond, Caramel, Honey Middle: Cardamom, Clove, Cinnamon, Tobacco, Anise Base: Tonka Bean, Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use.

Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Drunkin Pumpkin,1DRAMPODRP,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Smoke, Pumpkin, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds Middle: Toasted Sugar, Steamed Milk, Fine Bourbon Base: Amber, Vanilla, Musk Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Grandmas Garden,1DRAMPOGGN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Rose, Magnolia, Gardenia Middle: Tuberose Base: Iris Blossom Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Grandmas Candies,1DRAMPOGMC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Marshmallow Fluff Middle: Peppermint Base: Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Lemon Crinkle Cookie,1DRAMPOLCC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Lemon Zest, Lemon Balm Middle: Clove, Butter Base: Vanilla Cake, Vanilla, Cream Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Praline Pumpkin,1DRAMPOPPN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Candied Praline, Almond, Buttery, Milk, Orange Middle: Pumpkin Accord, Nutmeg, Anise, Cinnamon, Clove Leaf Base: Woody, Baked Vanilla, Tonka Bean Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner.

Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Strudel & Spice,SAS,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Orange Zest, Nutmeg, Cinnamon Bark Middle: Clove, Maple Syrup, Anise, Tonka Bean, Butter Base: Vanilla Sugar, Walnut Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting.

To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Snickerdoodle,1DRAMPOSNK,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Creamy Vanilla, Nutmeg Middle: Butter, Brown Sugar, Rum Base: Caramel, Cinnamon, Clove Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Spa Day,1DRAMPOSPA,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Lemon Grass, Lime, Lemon Middle: Jasmine, Sugar, Black Currant, Powder Base: Lily, Lavender, Lilac Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Sugar Coated Clementine,1DRAMPOSGC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Orange Peel, Apple Middle: Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Coconut Base: Vanilla, Tonka, Guaiacwood Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Toasted Pumpkin Spice,1DRAMPOTPS,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Smoke, Pumpkin, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds Middle: Toasted Sugar, Steamed Milk, Fine Bourbon Base: Amber, Vanilla, Musk Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Vanilla Bean Buttercream,1DRAMPOVBB,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Brown Sugar, Madagascar Vanilla Middle: Honey, Rich White Butter, Steamy Milk, Anise Seeds Base: Vanilla Bean, Cream Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Vermont Maple Shortbread,1DRAMPOVMS,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Brown Sugar, Crystallized Vanilla Middle: Warm Maple Syrup Base: Nutty Aroma, Vanilla Butter, Oatmeal, Cinnamon Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting. UV Lighting may cause discoloration to the oil wax blend but does not affect the integrity of the product.",,,,,,,2,99,,,,,2,JanMichael400,JanMichael160,https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-wb4uepr7/images/stencil/500x659/products/24588/73575/masvms__01455.1687530485.jpg,masvms__01455.1687530485.jpg,,,JanMichael800,masvms__01455.1687530485.jpg,

This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Roasted Caramel Coffee,1DRAMPORCC,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Coffee Middle: Caramel, Sugar Base: Milk, Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Nutty Praline,1DRAMPONPN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Caramelized Sugar, Sea Salt Middle: Butter, Praline, Pecan, Brown Sugar, Hazelnut Base: Caramel, Vanilla, Tonka Bean Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils.

Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting.

Strawberry Sunday Waffles,1DRAMPOSSW,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Waffle, Maple Middle: Strawberry, Cream Base: Custard, Pie Crust, Vanilla, Sugar Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower.

Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle.

Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting.

This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Salt Water Taffy,1DRAMPOSWT,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Strawberry, Raspberry, Banana Middle: Bing Cherry, Sugar, Wild Berry Base: Creamy Vanilla Taffy Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed.

Brownie Bites,1DRAMPOBRB,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Vanilla Middle: Cream, Hazelnut Base: Chocolate, Sugar, Praline Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Strawberry Pickins,1DRAMPOSRP,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Fresh Strawberries, Lemon, Orange Middle: Wild Berries, Golden Poundcake Base: Vanilla, Whipped Cream, Strawberry Jam, Sugar Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle. Car Diffusers: Boho style wooden and glass diffuser for cars and small spaces. Scent will last up to 6 months. WARNING: Do Not affix to rear view mirror, as this is prohibited in several states. Reed Diffuser: Our hand poured Reed Diffusers are a low maintenance & flame free way to give your home a warm and inviting aroma and they last approx. 3 + months. They are hand poured in small batches and contain 4 fl oz of premium fragrance that is phthalate free and infused with essential oils. They come in a frosted glass bottle with scent throw, all day long. Just set it up and forget it. You can also flip the reeds every so often to refresh. Pure Makers Oils: Our Pure Makers Oil is for any of your DIY projects. Some countless examples are candle making, car fresheners, air freshener sprays and simmer pots. Not made for direct refreshing purposes. Standard (Refresher) Oils: Standard Oil gives countless ways to refresh old or new potpourri, stale baskets, trash can liners, heat vents, kitchen drains, linen closets, gym bags or other scented products in the home that need refreshed. This would also be wonderful for making sachets. Store in a location free of UV lighting.

County Fair,1DRAMPOCOF,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Baked Apple Pie Middle: Sweet Corn, Ice Cream Base: Funnel Cake, Caramel Corn Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Fresh Cut Flowers,1DRAMPOFCF,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Lime, Hyacinth, Green Leaves Middle: Rose, Cyclamen, Lavender, Carnation Base: Gardenia, Lilac Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle.

This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Bourbon Pumpkin,1DRAMPOBPN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Pumpkin Spices, Maple Syrup Middle: Whiskey Accord, Caramelized Sugar Base: Bourbon Vanilla, Smoked Woods Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Minty Marshmallow,1DRAMPOMTM,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Marshmallow Fluff Middle: Peppermint Base: Vanilla Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Candy Apple,1DRAMPOCAN,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Green Leaves, Pear, Apple Blossom Middle: Apple Base: Crystal Musk, Vanilla, Cedarwood Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Winter Cranberry,1DRAMPOWCR,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Red Berries, Cassis, Apple, Peach, Bergamot, Cranberry Middle: Rhubarb, Green Leaves, Rose, Jasmine, Eucalyptus, Clove Base: Fir Needles, Cedarwood, Vanilla Sugar, Mucks Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower.

Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children.

Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use.

Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Nordic Pine,1DRAMPONOP,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Eucalyptus, Citrus Middle: Pine, Camphor Base: Balsam, Juniper, Cedar, Patchouli Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use.

Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Sleigh Ride,1DRAMPOSLR,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Orange Zests, Pineapple Middle: Mulled Apple Cider Base: Cinnamon, Clove Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass.

Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance.

Lemon Meringue,1DRAMPOLME,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Lemon Zest, Lemon Balm Middle: Clove, Butter Base: Vanilla Cake, Vanilla, Cream Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw. Some tart warmers get hotter than others. Tart warmers that get hot will produce a higher intensity fragrance, but the fragrance will dissipate much sooner. Tart warmers that do not get as hot tend to produce a less intense, but longer lasting aroma. Therefore, it is a tradeoff of intensity versus endurance. Linen and Room Spray: Each Cricket and Clover Room and Linen Spray is handmade in small batches in Lancaster, PA. Freshen up any room or linen with our handmade scents. This is just one more way of enjoying our preferred candle aromas, but in a flameless way. A burst of freshness is guaranteed with each spray from the 4oz bottle.

Lemon Meringue,1DRAMPOLME,,"Scent Note Profile: Top Note: Lemon Zest, Lemon Balm Middle: Clove, Butter Base: Vanilla Cake, Vanilla, Cream Soy Mason Jar Candles: Each candle is hand-poured in small batches into a pint-sized mason jar in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax burns at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean burn at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the candle a long-lasting experience of up to 84 hours of strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 12 ounces. Burning Instructions: The first time you light the candle, allow it to burn until the liquid wax covers the entire top of the candle. This breaking in process ensures that it will perform better and more evenly throughout the life of the candle. This will insure a clean and efficient burning cycle for the life of the candle. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep wicks trimmed to 1/4 inch. If you notice a large flame during burning, blow out the candle & trim the wick before re-lighting. Place burning candle on heat resistant surface. Never move a candle while hot or burning. Blow out the candle if jar becomes excessively hot. Keep out of drafts. Keep out of reach of children. To prevent candles from boring a hole down the middle, burn candles at a minimum of at least one hour for each inch in diameter. For example, burn a 3-inch diameter candle for a minimum of at least 3 hours each time. Burn long enough to achieve a melt pool that can be seen all the way around the glass. Soy Wax Melt: Each soy wax melt is hand-poured in small batches and sprinkled with assorted earthy botanicals into a clamshell in Lancaster, PA. Our vegan dye free soy wax melts at a cooler temperature and slower. This allows an extended clean melt at a slower rate, releasing the captivating scent at a more leisurely pace, and giving the soy wax melt a long-lasting experience of a strong scent throw. Fragrance oils used are cosmetic grade or pure essential oils all phthalate free. Net wax weight 2.75 ounces. Warning: Read all instructions for your wax melt and warmer prior to use. To prevent fire of injury: Remove melt from packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Use within sight. Do not touch hot wax. Hot wax can cause burn injury. Allow wax to harden before touching or handling. To avoid splatter, smoke, or flame, do not add water or fragrance oil to wax. Keep melts clear of debris. Do not attempt to use melt as a candle. Why do some wax melts seem to last longer than others? The temperature of the tart warmer is the single biggest factor to influence how long a wax melt will produce an effective scent throw.
